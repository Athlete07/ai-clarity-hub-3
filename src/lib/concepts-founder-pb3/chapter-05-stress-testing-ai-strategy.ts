  summary:
    "The exercise most founders avoid because they are afraid of what they will find — attacking your own strategy before competitors and investors do it for you.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "A strategy that cannot survive red team scrutiny is a roadmap with optimism. Stress-testing is not pessimism — it is how you pivot early enough to still have runway.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: if you are not embarrassed by the weaknesses your red team finds, you are not red-teaming hard enough. The goal is to break the strategy in a conference room, not in the market.",
