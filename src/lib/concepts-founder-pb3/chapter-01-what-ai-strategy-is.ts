  summary:
    "Most founders have an AI feature list. Almost none have an AI strategy. This chapter separates the two — and gives you the one-page template investors and boards actually want to see.",

    "An AI strategy is a theory of how you win: wedge, moat, feedback loop, expansion path. A feature list is a backlog. Founders who confuse them raise on demos and lose on diligence.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: your AI strategy is not what you will ship next quarter — it is why you will still matter when every competitor has the same API access. Write it before you write the roadmap.",
