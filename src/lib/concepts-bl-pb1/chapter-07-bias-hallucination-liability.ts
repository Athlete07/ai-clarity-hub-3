  readingMinutes: 25,
  summary:
    "Bias and hallucination are the two AI failure modes most likely to produce board-level consequences: regulatory enforcement, legal liability, reputational damage, and customer harm. Business leaders who understand these risks in non-technical terms can design appropriate governance, set correct board-level risk tolerances, and make AI deployment decisions with clear eyes.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Bias is not a technical accident — it is a structural property of models trained on historical data that reflects historical inequality. Hallucination is not a bug — it is a structural property of generative models that produce plausible outputs without a truth-checking mechanism. Both risks require governance architecture, not technical fixes alone.",
