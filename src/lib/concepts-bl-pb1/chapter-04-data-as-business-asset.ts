  summary:
    "In the AI era, proprietary data is a more defensible competitive advantage than the AI model itself. Models are rapidly commoditising; the data required to make them work for your specific context is not. Business leaders who treat their organisation's data as a strategic asset — investing in quality, custody, and flywheel design — build AI advantages that competitors cannot simply purchase.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Data is the moat. Models are the infrastructure. Your transaction history, customer interactions, operational records, and domain expertise are training assets that compound over time. Leaders who govern data as IP — with the same rigour as patents and contracts — build AI advantages that last.",
