  summary:
    "Understanding how models learn changes how you evaluate vendor claims, negotiate contracts, and set expectations for AI performance. The training process determines what the model can and cannot do — and that translates directly into business risk and budget decisions.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Models learn from data — and the quality, recency, and ownership of that data determines what the model can do for your business. Fine-tuning and transfer learning are the practical levers that make pre-trained models business-ready, but they require data investment and governance that must be planned before deployment.",
