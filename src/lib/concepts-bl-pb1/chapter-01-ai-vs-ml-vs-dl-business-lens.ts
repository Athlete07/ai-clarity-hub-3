  summary:
    "The distinction between AI, machine learning, and deep learning is not a technical quiz — it is a budget conversation. Leaders who can place a vendor's claim in the right category negotiate better contracts, avoid project failure, and make smarter board presentations.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI ⊃ ML ⊃ Deep Learning. Rules scale with headcount; learned systems scale with data. Generative AI is the newest commercial category inside deep learning. Your job is spotting where on this map every vendor sits before a dollar moves.",
