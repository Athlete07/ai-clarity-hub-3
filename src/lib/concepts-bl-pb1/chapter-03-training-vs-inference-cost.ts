  summary:
    "AI has two distinct cost phases: training (building the model) and inference (using it). Most enterprise AI budget is consumed at inference, not training — and the cost dynamics are non-linear in ways that surprise finance teams who plan from pilot data. This chapter gives business leaders the economic vocabulary to plan, negotiate, and govern AI costs.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Inference cost is your AI variable cost of goods sold — it scales with usage in ways pilot budgets routinely underestimate. Training cost is a capital expenditure that most organisations should not incur directly. TCO analysis, tier selection, and latency-cost trade-offs are the CFO levers that make AI economics work.",
