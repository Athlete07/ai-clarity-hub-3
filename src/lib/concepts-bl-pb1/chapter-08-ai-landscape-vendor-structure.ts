  summary:
    "The AI vendor landscape is complex, rapidly consolidating, and structured in ways that create specific risks for buyers. Business leaders who understand the AI value chain — from foundation model providers through cloud platforms to application vendors — negotiate better contracts, manage concentration risk, and make vendor decisions with clear eyes about dependency and switching cost.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The AI vendor landscape has three layers: foundation model providers, cloud AI platforms, and application vendors. Your risk is concentrated differently at each layer. Understanding where your AI value chain is exposed — to pricing changes, vendor failure, or model deprecation — is the buyer's primary protection.",
