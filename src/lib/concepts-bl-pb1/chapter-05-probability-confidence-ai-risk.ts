  readingMinutes: 23,
  summary:
    "AI does not produce facts — it produces probability-weighted outputs. Business leaders who understand probabilistic outputs, confidence scores, and the cost of errors can set appropriate thresholds, design correct human-oversight architectures, and communicate AI risk accurately to boards, regulators, and customers.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Every AI output is a probability, not a certainty. The threshold you set between accepting and rejecting AI outputs is a business decision — not a technical one — that determines your error rate, your human oversight cost, and your liability exposure. Leaders who own threshold decisions own AI risk.",
