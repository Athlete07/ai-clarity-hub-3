    "Business leaders are presented with AI performance claims in vendor pitches, project updates, and board reports. Understanding which metrics matter, which mislead, and how to commission independent evaluation protects organisations from expensive AI disappointments and enables better vendor negotiation.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Accuracy is the least useful AI evaluation metric in most business contexts. Precision, recall, and business-outcome metrics — calibrated against relevant baselines — are the numbers that tell you whether an AI system will actually improve your operation.",
