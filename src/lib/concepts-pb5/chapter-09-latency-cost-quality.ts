  summary:
    "Every AI product decision sits on a three-way tradeoff — latency users feel, cost the business pays, and quality that drives retention — and PMs who map their use case to the right corner of the triangle make defensible model, architecture, and SLA choices instead of defaulting to the biggest model.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "You can optimize two corners of the triangle at once, rarely all three. The PM job is picking which corner to sacrifice for which user moment — and documenting that choice before eng ships Opus for a autocomplete field.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: put latency p95, cost per session, and one quality metric on the same PRD slide. If you can't state which leg you're sacrificing and why, you're not making a product decision — you're accepting the eng default.",
