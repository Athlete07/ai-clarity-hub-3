    "The hardware decision that determines your cost floor and latency ceiling — parallel GPUs vs general-purpose CPUs, and when each wins",
  keyTakeaway:
    "GPUs dominate LLM inference because matrix multiplication parallelises across thousands of cores; CPUs win for small models, low throughput, and cost-sensitive edge cases. VRAM is often the binding constraint, not FLOPs — and cloud GPU economics (on-demand vs reserved vs spot) belong in every unit-cost model.",
