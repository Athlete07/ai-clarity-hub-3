  summary:
    "Two fundamentally different ways to run models — batch throughput vs streaming tokens — and how the choice shapes UX, cost, and architecture",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Batch inference maximises GPU utilisation by processing many inputs together; streaming inference delivers tokens as they're generated so users see progress. Real-time serving answers single requests immediately. Production systems mix all three — and perceived latency often matters more than wall-clock time.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: streaming a 4-second response feels instant; waiting 4 seconds for a block feels broken — even when the total time is identical. Design for perceived latency, not just benchmarks.",
