  summary:
    "Why AI products need explicit model versioning beyond git tags — registries, prompt pins, embedding coupling, rollback playbooks, vendor deprecation, and the PM policies that keep production behaviour explainable when the model changes without a code deploy.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "A model version is a product commitment — not just a string in a config file. Without version pins, registries, and rollback paths, every vendor update or prompt tweak is an unreviewed release to every user.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: maintain a version manifest — model ID, prompt hash, embedding version, eval score at ship — for every production slice. If support can't answer 'what version answered this query?', you don't have versioning, you have hope.",
