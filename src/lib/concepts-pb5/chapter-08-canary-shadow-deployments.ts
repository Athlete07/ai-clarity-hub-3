  summary:
    "How to de-risk AI releases with canary traffic ramps, shadow (dark) deployments, feature flags, rollout gates, blue/green patterns, automated rollback, and PM-owned playbooks — because shipping a new model is a production experiment whether you plan it or not.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Canary and shadow deployments let you learn from real traffic before every user pays the cost of failure — canaries expose a small slice to new behaviour; shadows run the new stack in parallel without affecting users. PMs define the gates; eng wires the pipes.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: never approve a model or prompt promotion without naming the canary percentage, success metrics, rollback trigger, and who can pull the kill switch at 2am. 'We'll monitor it' is not a rollout plan.",
