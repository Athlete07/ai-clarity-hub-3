  summary:
    "Where inference runs shapes privacy, latency, cost, and offline behaviour. On-device NPUs, cloud GPU fleets, hybrid routing, and the PM frameworks for choosing — or combining — edge and cloud in production AI products.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Edge inference keeps data local and cuts round-trip latency; cloud inference brings frontier-scale models and elastic capacity. Most mature products route by sensitivity, connectivity, and task complexity — not a single global choice.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: 'edge vs cloud' is not an architecture religion. It's a routing policy — which queries stay on device, which escalate to cloud, and what happens when the network drops.",
