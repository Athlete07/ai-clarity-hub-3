  summary:
    "How to shrink models without killing quality — post-training quantisation, quantisation-aware training, GGUF/GPTQ/AWQ formats, and knowledge distillation from teacher to student. The compression stack PMs use when inference COGS or latency budgets bite.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Quantisation reduces numeric precision to cut memory and speed up inference; distillation trains a smaller model to mimic a larger one. Together they are how frontier capability reaches affordable product tiers — but both require eval discipline, not faith in vendor benchmarks.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: when engineering says 'we'll quantise to 4-bit,' your job is to ask 'on which eval set, with what quality delta, and what's the rollback plan?' Compression is a product tradeoff, not a checkbox.",
