  summary:
    "An AI Centre of Excellence is the organisational mechanism that prevents every business function from solving the same AI problems independently at higher cost and lower quality than a shared capability could achieve. Business leaders who design their CoE mandate, governance model, and resourcing strategy deliberately build a function that compounds in value. Those who create a CoE reactively — in response to AI chaos in the organisation — spend two years fixing structural problems that a deliberate design would have prevented.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "An AI Centre of Excellence is not an AI team — it is an enabling function. Its job is to make every business function's AI capability better than it would be alone: through shared standards, reusable infrastructure, vendor relationships, talent development, and governance. A CoE that tries to own and control AI across the organisation becomes a bottleneck. A CoE that enables and amplifies function-level AI becomes a multiplier.",

      subtitle: "Four functions that distinguish a value-creating CoE from an AI bureaucracy",
      take: "An AI Centre of Excellence creates value through four activities: establishing shared standards that prevent every function from making the same governance mistakes, building shared infrastructure that reduces the cost of AI deployment for all functions, developing talent that individual functions could not develop independently, and managing the vendor relationships that give the organisation purchasing leverage. A CoE that does these four things is a force multiplier. A CoE that primarily reviews, approves, or controls AI initiatives is a governance bureaucracy.",
      why: "Business leaders who sponsor a CoE must understand what it should and should not do before designing it. The most common CoE failure mode is mission creep from enabling to controlling — a transition that happens gradually and is often welcomed by the CoE team but resisted by the functions it was designed to serve.",
