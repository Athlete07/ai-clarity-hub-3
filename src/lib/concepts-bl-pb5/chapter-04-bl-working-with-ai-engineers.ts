  summary:
    "AI engineers build the systems that business leaders deploy — but the quality of what gets built depends almost entirely on the quality of the collaboration between business and engineering. Business leaders who learn to brief AI engineers precisely, give useful feedback on AI outputs, and set realistic expectations for delivery timelines get AI systems that solve business problems. Those who do not get technically correct systems that miss the point.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Effective collaboration with AI engineers requires three skills that no technical background is needed to develop: writing business requirements in a format engineers can act on, giving feedback on AI outputs that distinguishes data problems from model problems from requirement problems, and knowing when to challenge engineering timelines based on business risk rather than technical preference.",

Understanding these four activities helps business leaders know what to ask for, what is realistic to expect, and when a problem is a business specification issue versus an engineering challenge.",
      why: "Business leaders who do not understand what AI engineers do cannot tell when they are being misled, cannot evaluate timeline estimates, and cannot frame requirements in terms that engineers can act on.
