  summary:
    "The most consequential talent decision a business leader makes during AI adoption is whether to build AI capability by upskilling existing employees or by bringing in new AI hires. The answer is not universal — it depends on the type of capability gap, the speed required, the cost of each path, and the cultural implications of each choice. Leaders who default to hiring without modelling the build option systematically overpay and underinvest in the organisation's long-term adaptive capacity.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Upskilling existing employees is typically faster, cheaper, and more culturally sustainable for AI working knowledge and practitioner roles. External hiring is the right answer for net-new specialist skills that do not exist in the organisation and cannot be built within the deployment timeline. Most organisations need a deliberate mix of both — and the mix should be decided by the gap type, not by HR convention.",

      take: "The upskill vs hire decision should be driven by four variables: the type of capability gap (new knowledge, new skill, or entirely new role), the time available before the gap becomes a deployment blocker, the total cost of each path including hidden costs, and the cultural message each choice sends to the existing workforce. Any decision made without analysing all four variables produces a suboptimal outcome.",
      why: "Business leaders who treat this as a simple cost comparison miss the cultural variable — which often determines whether an AI adoption programme succeeds or fails. A workforce that sees leadership default to external AI hiring rather than investing in internal capability development responds with lower engagement and higher resistance to AI tools.",
