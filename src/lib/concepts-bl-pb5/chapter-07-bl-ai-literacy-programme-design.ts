  summary:
    "An AI literacy programme is only valuable if it changes how people work, not just how people think about AI. Most enterprise AI literacy programmes fail this test: they produce informed employees who do not change their daily behaviour. The programmes that succeed share four design principles: they are role-specific rather than generic, workflow-embedded rather than classroom-based, continuously updated as AI tools evolve, and measured by behavioural outcomes rather than learning completion metrics.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The single most important AI literacy design decision is the choice between generic AI education (applicable to everyone, changes no one) and role-specific AI capability development (applicable to specific roles, changes their daily work). Generic programmes are cheaper and easier to commission; role-specific programmes are 3–4× more expensive to design but 5–6× more effective at producing adoption. Design the programme you need, not the programme you can afford to run at scale.",

      why: "Business leaders who commission generic AI literacy programmes and measure success by completion rates are buying the appearance of AI capability development rather than the reality.
