  summary:
    "AI adoption measurement is the discipline that separates AI programmes that deliver sustained business value from those that deliver initial activity followed by invisible decline. Most organisations measure AI adoption with the wrong metrics — login rates, training completions, user counts — that capture tool presence but not tool integration into workflow. The metrics that predict sustained value are workflow depth (how deeply AI is integrated into operational decisions), output quality improvement, and business outcome change. These metrics take more effort to capture but are the only ones that justify continued AI investment.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The adoption metrics worth measuring are the ones that change when AI is genuinely integrated into how work gets done: decision quality improvement, workflow cycle time reduction, output quality uplift, and error rate reduction. Login rates and training completions are activity metrics — useful for diagnosing support needs but not for justifying continued AI investment or measuring AI programme success.",

      title: "Why most AI adoption metrics are vanity metrics",
      subtitle: "The metrics that look good in dashboards and tell you nothing about business value",
      take: "Vanity metrics are metrics that can improve without any improvement in business outcomes. In AI adoption, the classic vanity metrics are: number of users who have logged in (tells you nothing about use quality), training completion rate (tells you nothing about skill transfer), number of AI features available (tells you nothing about features used), and total AI queries submitted (tells you nothing about whether AI outputs were used). These metrics are easy to collect, look impressive in presentations, and are highly gameable without any genuine adoption occurring.",
      why: "Leaders who manage AI adoption using vanity metrics will consistently believe their programmes are succeeding when they are not. The metrics will show progress; the business results will not change. Vanity metrics are not harmless — they produce investment decisions based on false signals and delay the detection of adoption failures until they have compounded into programme failures.",
