  summary:
    "An AI champion network is the most cost-effective adoption mechanism available to a business leader — a distributed network of credible peers who model AI behaviour, support colleagues' adoption, and surface adoption barriers before they become programme failures. The difference between an AI champion network that works and one that burns out in 6 months is the design: champions must be selected carefully, enabled generously, and given a mandate that extends their current role rather than replacing it.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "An AI champion network is not a volunteer enthusiasm programme — it is a formal, resourced capability that requires named role accountability, explicit time allocation, structured enablement, and regular governance. Champion networks that lack any of these four elements consistently burn out or drift from purpose within 6–12 months. Networks that have all four consistently sustain AI adoption above the organisational average for 3 years or more.",

      subtitle: "The mechanism that makes peer influence a deliberate adoption strategy",
      take: "An AI champion network formalises what happens organically in every AI adoption programme — a small number of enthusiastic, capable employees who help their colleagues adopt AI tools. Formalising this informal behaviour gives it structure, scale, support, and sustainability that organic enthusiasm alone cannot maintain. The network works because peer influence is the most effective adoption mechanism available, and the champion network is the infrastructure that makes peer influence systematic rather than accidental.",
      why: "Business leaders who rely on organic AI enthusiasm to spread adoption are depending on a mechanism they cannot manage, measure, or sustain. A champion network converts the same peer influence mechanism into a managed, measurable capability that can be directed toward the functions, use cases, and populations where adoption support is most needed.",

An employee who sees a colleague they respect using an AI tool and genuinely benefiting from it is more motivated to try the tool than they would be after any number of leadership communications, vendor demonstrations, or training sessions. The champion network makes this peer influence deliberate: it identifies credible peers, develops their AI capability, and creates channels for their influence to reach colleagues who would not naturally encounter it.",
            "The key word is 'credible': the peer must be respected for their domain expertise and practical judgement, not just for their AI enthusiasm. An AI enthusiast who everyone knows loves technology is not a champion — they are a hobbyist. An operations manager who was sceptical, tried AI, and found it changed how they work is a champion.",

        "Correct. A champion deployed into a function without active AI deployment, without management support, or without a function AI contact will fail to perform the champion role — and the failure will be visible. Failed champion experiments reduce the programme's credibility and make future champion recruitment harder in those functions.",
      wrongFeedback:
        "Premature deployment into unready functions produces visible champion failures that damage the credibility of the champion model. Functions that see champions deployed without the conditions for success will conclude the champion model does not work — rather than that the conditions for success were not in place. Readiness assessment prevents this.",
