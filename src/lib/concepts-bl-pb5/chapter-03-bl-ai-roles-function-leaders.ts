  summary:
    "AI is creating new roles inside every business function — not just in technology teams. Function leaders who understand the emerging AI role landscape can design their teams for AI effectiveness rather than discovering the gaps when deployment fails. The new roles are not all technical: AI product owners, output reviewers, workflow designers, and human-AI translators are as important to function performance as data scientists and engineers.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Every function needs at minimum three AI role types: an AI workflow owner (manages how AI tools are embedded in function processes), AI output reviewers (check AI outputs before they affect decisions), and an AI champion (drives adoption and surfaces improvement opportunities). These roles can be held by existing employees with targeted development — they do not require new headcount in most functions.",

Understanding the new role landscape is a function leader's prerequisite for team design, gap assessment, and AI adoption planning.

      why: "Function leaders who only think about AI in terms of technology tools miss the human capability layer that determines whether tools deliver value. Every AI tool requires at least one human role to configure it, one to use it, and one to verify its outputs.
