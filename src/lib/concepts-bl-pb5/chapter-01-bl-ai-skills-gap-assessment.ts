  summary:
    "Every organisation deploying AI discovers the same problem: the gap between current team capability and the capability required to extract value from AI is wider than expected, and it sits in different places for different functions. Business leaders who map this gap before spending on tools or training avoid the most expensive mistake in AI adoption — building capability in the wrong places.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "An AI skills gap is not a single gap — it is a portfolio of gaps across awareness, working knowledge, practitioner skill, and leadership decision-making. Mapping all four layers before procuring training or hiring is the step that separates organisations that adopt AI effectively from those that spend on it without return.",
