  summary:
    "AI adoption fails twice as often from change management failure as from technical failure. The tools work; the people do not change how they work. Business leaders who apply structured change management to AI adoption consistently achieve 2–3× higher adoption rates than those who treat adoption as a communications exercise. The ADKAR model — Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement — provides the most validated framework for AI adoption change management, with modifications for the specific dynamics of AI-driven change.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The critical difference between AI change management and standard change management is the fear variable: AI adoption triggers job security anxiety that most change programmes are not designed to address. A change management approach that ignores this fear — treating AI adoption as equivalent to a software upgrade — will achieve partial adoption at best. Addressing job security anxiety directly and early is the single highest-leverage change management action a business leader can take.",

      take: "AI adoption triggers four dynamics that standard change management frameworks are not fully designed for: pervasive job security anxiety that affects people who are not directly impacted, the unpredictability of AI capability (people do not know how much their role will change), the speed of AI evolution (the change is not a one-time event but a continuous adjustment), and the authority gap (people are asked to trust AI outputs before they understand how those outputs are produced). Each dynamic requires a specific change management response that standard frameworks do not provide.",
      why: "Business leaders who use standard change management approaches for AI adoption — communications, training, and manager briefings — achieve 40–60% of target adoption. Leaders who augment standard approaches with responses to the four AI-specific dynamics achieve 70–90% adoption. The gap is entirely attributable to the AI-specific elements that standard approaches miss.",
