  summary:
    "AI resistance is not a character flaw in employees — it is a rational response to genuine uncertainty, and it must be treated as evidence, not as an obstacle. The most common leadership mistake in managing AI resistance is attempting to overcome it through persuasion, mandate, or social pressure. Resistance that is overcome through pressure does not disappear — it goes underground, producing passive non-compliance that is far more damaging to AI adoption than explicit resistance. The most effective approach is diagnosing the type of resistance first and then designing a targeted response.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI resistance has three distinct sources — fear-based, capability-based, and values-based — and each requires a different response. Fear-based resistance requires honest communication about job impact. Capability-based resistance requires targeted training and supervised practice. Values-based resistance requires genuine dialogue about AI ethics, bias, and the limits of AI in high-stakes decisions. Conflating the three sources and applying a single solution produces responses that are effective for one type and counterproductive for the others.",

      take: "AI resistance originates from three sources that require different responses: fear (job security, status loss, uncertainty), capability (inability to use AI effectively, fear of looking incompetent), and values (ethical concerns about AI, distrust of AI's objectivity, concern about AI replacing human judgement in consequential decisions). Most AI adoption programmes address only the first source and in doing so miss the 40–60% of resistance that comes from capability and values sources.",
      why: "Leaders who treat all resistance as fear-based resistance apply communications solutions (reassurance, leadership endorsement, positive messaging) to capability and values problems — which produces no change in the resistant behaviour. Diagnosing resistance source before designing the response is the difference between targeted and wasteful intervention.",

        "Correct. The two-part strategy addresses both dimensions of senior leader resistance: private coaching removes the identity threat that group training creates (enablement); governance dashboard inclusion creates peer accountability pressure (accountability). Neither works alone; together they are the most effective approach.",

        "The most effective strategy combines enablement (private coaching to develop capability without the identity threat of group settings) and accountability (governance dashboard visibility to peers). Mandating training creates compliance without engagement; relying on CEO conversation depends on the CEO being willing and the conversation being persuasive.",
