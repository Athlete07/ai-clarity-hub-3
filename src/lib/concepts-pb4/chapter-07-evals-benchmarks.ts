  summary:
    "How to measure whether your AI feature actually works — unit tests, human eval, LLM-as-judge, golden datasets, regression suites, and the frameworks that automate them. Why evals are the hardest part of shipping AI and how PMs own the bar.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Traditional software has pass/fail tests; AI has distributions of acceptable answers. Evals are how you turn subjective quality into a release gate — and without them, every prompt change is a coin flip in production.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: define the eval before you define the feature. If you can't write down what 'good' looks like in 20 test cases, you don't have requirements — you have a demo.",
