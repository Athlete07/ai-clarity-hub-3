  summary:
    "Input and output guardrails, Constitutional AI, moderation APIs, NeMo and Guardrails AI, the safety-helpfulness tradeoff, jailbreaks, and the EU AI Act and NIST landscape — how PMs ship capable AI without shipping liability.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Guardrails are product policy encoded in software — filters, classifiers, and rules that run before and after the model. They don't replace safe design and eval, but they're the enforcement layer between 'the model can say X' and 'our product must never say X.'",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: write the refusal policy in plain English before eng picks a framework. 'Block hate speech' is not a spec — 'refuse requests for weapon synthesis; allow historical discussion with educational framing' is.",
