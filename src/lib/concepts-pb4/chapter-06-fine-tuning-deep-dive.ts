  summary:
    "Full fine-tuning, LoRA, QLoRA, instruction tuning, DPO, and RLHF — the adaptation stack PMs navigate when prompting and RAG stop being enough. What each technique buys, what it costs, and how to choose.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Fine-tuning changes model weights to bake in behaviour; LoRA/QLoRA make it affordable; instruction tuning shapes format; DPO and RLHF align outputs to human preferences. The PM job is matching technique to failure mode — not defaulting to fine-tune because it sounds serious.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: before you approve a fine-tuning sprint, write down the failure mode ('model won't follow JSON schema' vs 'model tone is wrong' vs 'model lacks domain facts'). The failure mode picks the technique — not the other way around.",
