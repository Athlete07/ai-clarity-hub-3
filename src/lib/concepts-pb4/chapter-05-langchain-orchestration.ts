  summary:
    "LangChain is the duct tape of LLM applications — chains, agents, tools, memory, and observability hooks in one ecosystem. Understand what it buys you, what it costs, and when lighter orchestration wins.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "LangChain is an orchestration framework, not a model. It composes LLM calls, retrieval, tools, and memory into pipelines — valuable for prototyping and standard patterns, but it adds abstraction debt you'll eventually need to justify or shed.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: don't let 'we'll use LangChain' substitute for a sequence diagram. Ask what chain runs on which user action, what happens when step 3 fails, and what LangSmith trace you'll use to debug it in production.",
