  summary:
    "Why AI observability differs from traditional APM, what to log, multi-step tracing, prompt versioning, latency and cost breakdown, drift detection, LangSmith/W&B/Arize/Helicone/Langfuse, and closing feedback loops — how PMs debug production AI at scale.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "You can't fix what you can't see. AI observability captures prompts, retrieval, tool calls, latencies, costs, and outcomes as linked traces — the flight recorder for non-deterministic systems — and PMs use it to turn user complaints into reproducible failures.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: ask for a trace link in every bug report template. If support can't paste a trace ID, you don't have observability — you have archaeology.",
