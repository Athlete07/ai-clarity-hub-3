  summary:
    "First-pass retrieval gets you in the ballpark; reranking decides what actually reaches the model. Cross-encoders, fusion strategies, and cost tradeoffs — the second stage every serious RAG pipeline eventually adds.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Reranking is a second-pass scoring step that re-orders retrieval candidates using a more accurate (and more expensive) model. It trades latency and compute for precision at the top of the context window — where it matters most.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: if your RAG answers cite the wrong document 30% of the time, the fix is rarely 'bigger embeddings.' It's usually 'rerank the top 20 before you stuff them into the prompt.' Know when that tradeoff pays for itself.",
