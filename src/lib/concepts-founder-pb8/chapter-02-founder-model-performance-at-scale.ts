  summary:
    "Models that work in demos fail in production. Models that work in production fail at scale. Distribution shift, long-tail failures, latency degradation, and monitoring gaps — the failure modes that only appear with real users, and the cadence founders need to catch them.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Production model performance is a moving target. Scale introduces distribution shift, adversarial inputs, and latency cliffs that your test set never simulated. Monitoring, segment-level alerting, and disciplined A/B testing are not MLOps luxuries — they are founder survival infrastructure.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: assume your model is degrading right now and you cannot see it yet. Install production monitoring before you scale marketing — the 1% long-tail inputs that cause 80% of incidents only appear at volume.",
