  summary:
    "Your company structure breaks at the same time your infrastructure does. AI team structures that work at 10 people fail at 50, cross-functional alignment fractures, and institutional knowledge walks out the door — unless you plan the org chart 18 months ahead.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Technical scaling without organisational scaling produces incidents nobody owns, decisions nobody remembers, and hires you make six months too late. The founder's job is to anticipate structural breakpoints — centralised vs embedded AI, knowledge management, and the MLOps and governance roles that prevent fires.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: your org chart is a scaling constraint as real as your GPU budget. Map the transition from centralised AI team to embedded engineers before product complexity forces it chaotically — and hire MLOps and data quality before the pipeline breaks, not after.",
