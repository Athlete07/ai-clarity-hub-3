  summary:
    "The data problems invisible at 1,000 users become company-threatening at 100,000. Training contamination, feedback loop corruption, pipeline failures, and governance gaps — and the audit founders must run before every major model update.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Data quality is not a preprocessing step — it is a scaling constraint. Bad data entering your training pipeline silently degrades models. Corrupted feedback loops optimise toward the wrong objective. Founders who scale data collection without scaling governance ship regressions disguised as improvements.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: your feedback loop is only as honest as your data pipeline. Before you celebrate model improvement, ask whether training data still represents the users you serve today — not the users you had six months ago.",
