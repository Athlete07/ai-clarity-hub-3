    "The moments in your growth curve where the financial model changes fundamentally. Model negotiation thresholds, build-vs-buy crossover, fine-tuning ROI, margin evolution, and the analysis that proves to investors you understand your own cost structure before Series B.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI unit economics are not static — they inflect at predictable volume thresholds. Founders who model inflection points before they arrive can negotiate, rearchitect, and fundraise from strength. Those who discover them through margin collapse restructure from weakness.",

    "As a founder: map your four inflection points — API negotiation, build-vs-buy crossover, fine-tuning ROI, and margin floor — on a single timeline before your Series B. Investors fund founders who understand when their economics change, not founders surprised by them.",
