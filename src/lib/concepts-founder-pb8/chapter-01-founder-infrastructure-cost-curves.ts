  summary:
    "The unit economics that looked fine at 1,000 users look very different at 100,000. How AI infrastructure costs scale non-linearly, the levers that bend the curve, and the spreadsheet your board expects before you celebrate product-market fit.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Inference costs dominate AI margins and scale faster than revenue unless you architect for it. Model routing, caching, and prompt compression are not optimisation projects — they are survival infrastructure. Build the cost model before the bill surprises your CFO.",

    "As a founder: your pilot cost model is wrong at production scale. Model the non-linear inference curve now — cost per conversation, cost per successful task, and margin at 10x and 100x — before growth turns a win into a cash burn crisis.",
