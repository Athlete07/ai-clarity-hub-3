  summary:
    "AI contracts contain terms that do not exist in traditional software agreements — and traditional software terms that mean something fundamentally different when applied to AI. Business leaders who negotiate AI contracts without understanding these differences sign agreements that expose them to open-ended liability, model performance risk, unconstrained data use, and vendor dependency. Understanding the twelve most important AI contract terms is not a legal skill — it is a business leadership competency.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The twelve AI-specific contract terms that require negotiation are: model performance warranty, accuracy threshold with remedy, training data restriction, output ownership, liability cap calibration, indemnification scope, change-of-control, model update notification, audit rights, data return and deletion, termination for convenience, and post-termination support. Missing or misconfigured versions of these terms are the source of 90% of AI contract disputes.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: every AI contract term you accept without reading is a risk you have agreed to absorb. The vendor's standard terms are optimised for the vendor's interests. Your job in contract negotiation is to identify the terms where your interests and the vendor's interests diverge — and close the gap before signature.",
