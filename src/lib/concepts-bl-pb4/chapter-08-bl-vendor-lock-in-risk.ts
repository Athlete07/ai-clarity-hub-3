  summary:
    "AI vendor lock-in is deeper and more costly than traditional software lock-in because it operates at four levels simultaneously: data lock-in (your data is in proprietary formats), model lock-in (your teams are trained on specific AI outputs), workflow lock-in (your processes are rebuilt around AI outputs), and infrastructure lock-in (your IT architecture depends on the vendor's specific APIs). Business leaders who assess lock-in risk before signing and negotiate portability provisions before committing can reduce exit costs by 60–80% and maintain the negotiating leverage that comes from a credible exit option.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI lock-in risk is best managed before contract signature, not after. The four lock-in mechanisms — data, model, workflow, and infrastructure — each have a specific mitigation strategy. A business leader who identifies the lock-in risk profile of each AI procurement decision, negotiates the appropriate portability provisions, and maintains a documented exit plan retains strategic flexibility throughout the contract term.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: vendor lock-in is not a technical risk — it is a strategic risk. A vendor who knows you cannot exit without significant cost behaves differently than a vendor who knows you can switch in 90 days. Portability provisions are not exit planning — they are negotiating leverage instruments that change vendor behaviour throughout the contract term.",

      correctFeedback: "Correct. Open-source model fine-tuning creates portable model weights that can be deployed on any compatible hosting infrastructure. When you change hosting vendors, you move the weights — no retraining required. Proprietary model fine-tuning creates weights that are inseparable from the vendor's infrastructure, requiring full retraining to switch vendors.",
      wrongFeedback: "The lock-in advantage of open-source fine-tuning is portability: the fine-tuned weights are yours to run anywhere compatible hardware exists. Accuracy, cost, and fine-tuning availability are secondary considerations compared to the strategic flexibility that portable weights provide.",

      q: "At what portfolio lock-in signal level should a business leader escalate AI vendor risk to the board?",
      options: [
        "When any single vendor has a lock-in score above 8/12",
        "When the portfolio is approaching 40% of AI spend with a single vendor, exit cost cascade risk is present, or more than two vendors have no operational portability provisions",
        "When the total exit cost across the portfolio exceeds $1M",
        "When the board specifically requests an AI vendor risk review",
      ],
      correct: 1,
      correctFeedback: "Correct. The three portfolio-level signals requiring board escalation are: concentration risk (>40% spend with one vendor), exit cost cascade risk (inability to absorb simultaneous multi-vendor replacement), and portability provision gap (>2 vendors with no operational protections). Any one of these signals indicates strategic vulnerability requiring board-level attention.",
      wrongFeedback: "Board escalation is triggered by portfolio-level structural risks: concentration (>40% with one vendor), cascade risk (multiple simultaneous replacements unaffordable), or portability gap (>2 vendors unprotected). Individual vendor lock-in scores and absolute cost thresholds are management-level signals, not board-level escalation triggers.",
