  summary:
    "AI vendor pitches are among the most sophisticated sales experiences in enterprise technology: they blend genuine innovation with AI hype, credible benchmarks with misleading statistics, and compelling demos with cherry-picked data. Business leaders who can identify the fifteen most common red flags in AI vendor pitches protect their organisations from expensive mistakes and their own reputations from association with failed deployments.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The most dangerous AI vendor pitches are the most convincing ones. A polished demo, impressive benchmark statistics, and a compelling founder story are not evidence of enterprise readiness. The fifteen red flags in this chapter identify the gap between sales theatre and operational reality — and each flag is actionable before you leave the meeting room.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: an AI vendor's pitch is designed to maximise your confidence in their technology and urgency toward a contract commitment. Every question you ask that exposes a red flag is a moment where you protect your organisation. Ask the uncomfortable questions while you still have negotiating leverage.",
