  summary:
    "An AI pilot is not a trial — it is a structured experiment designed to generate specific evidence about whether the AI can deliver defined business value under defined conditions, within a defined timeline. Business leaders who design pilots rigorously generate the evidence they need for go/no-go decisions. Business leaders who treat pilots as extended evaluations generate enthusiasm, not evidence — and eventually sign full contracts based on optimism rather than data.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "A well-designed AI pilot has six elements: bounded scope (one use case, one team), pre-agreed success criteria with numerical thresholds, a control group for comparison, a fixed timeline with a scheduled go/no-go decision, data access restrictions in a signed agreement, and a named decision owner. Pilots missing any of these elements cannot produce reliable go/no-go evidence — and 'we learned a lot' is not a go/no-go outcome.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: a pilot that cannot produce a clear go/no-go decision is not a pilot — it is a vendor relationship you have not yet formalised. Design the success criteria before the pilot begins, or the vendor will define success after the pilot ends.",

      correctFeedback: "Correct. Go decisions require meeting criteria or a specific, time-bounded conditional path. Vague improvement requests, post-hoc criteria challenges, and below-threshold adoption rates are no-go signals regardless of technical performance.",
      wrongFeedback: "Go decisions are based on criteria met or specific conditional gaps that are time-bounded and measurable. 'More time' requests, retrospective criteria challenges, and adoption failures are no-go signals — adoption failure means the AI will not deliver value at scale even if technical performance is strong.",

      q: "Why should the go/no-go meeting date be scheduled before the pilot begins rather than at the end of the measurement period?",
      options: [
        "To ensure the vendor has adequate notice to prepare their performance summary",
        "To prevent the sunk cost effect — once a team has invested significant time in a pilot, they are psychologically disposed to find success",
        "To comply with standard procurement governance timelines",

      correct: 1,
      correctFeedback: "Correct. A go/no-go meeting scheduled at the start of a pilot establishes the decision standard at a point when no sunk cost has accumulated. A meeting scheduled at the end of a pilot is subject to the sunk cost effect: teams who have invested weeks in a pilot are psychologically disposed to favour a go outcome regardless of the evidence.",
      wrongFeedback: "The primary reason for scheduling the go/no-go meeting before the pilot begins is to establish the decision standard before sunk cost accumulates. The longer a team invests in a pilot, the more psychologically difficult it becomes to make a no-go decision — even when the evidence supports it.",

      options: [
        "Set the threshold at the pilot average performance — representing typical expected performance",
        "Set the threshold at the pilot peak performance — requiring the vendor to maintain their best observed performance",
        "Set the threshold at 90% of pilot peak performance — accounting for production variability while being grounded in observed evidence",
        "Set the threshold at the industry benchmark for the AI category — using market standards rather than pilot data",
      ],
      correct: 2,
      correctFeedback: "Correct. 90% of pilot peak performance is the recommended threshold formula: it is grounded in observed evidence (not market benchmarks), accounts for the pilot-to-production gap and model variation, and is not punitive relative to the vendor's demonstrated capability.",
      wrongFeedback: "The performance warranty threshold should be set at 90% of the pilot peak performance. This is grounded in evidence (the pilot measurement), accounts for production variability (the 10% buffer), and is not punitive (the vendor has demonstrated they can achieve the underlying performance). Average performance sets the bar too low; peak performance is too demanding.",
