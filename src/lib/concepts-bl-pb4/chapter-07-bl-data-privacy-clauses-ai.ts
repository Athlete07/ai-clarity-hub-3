  summary:
    "AI contracts create data privacy obligations that standard software contracts do not: personal data flows into AI training pipelines, AI outputs may constitute automated decision-making under GDPR, and AI model weights may encode personal information in ways that standard deletion processes cannot address. Business leaders who understand the seven most important privacy clauses in AI contracts protect their organisations from GDPR fines, data subject rights claims, and cross-border transfer violations.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Seven data privacy clauses are essential in every AI contract that processes personal data: data processing agreement (DPA) with Article 28 compliance, automated decision-making restriction or Article 22 safeguards, training data opt-out with GDPR basis specification, data minimisation commitment, cross-border transfer mechanism, data subject rights fulfilment obligation, and privacy by design certification. Missing any of these is not a contractual oversight — it is a GDPR compliance gap.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: when your AI vendor processes personal data, you become a data controller and the vendor becomes a data processor. Every GDPR obligation that applies to you — data subject rights, breach notification, cross-border transfers — flows through the AI contract. The contract is your GDPR compliance mechanism.",

Each creates controller obligations that must be managed through contract terms with the AI vendor.",
      why: "Business leaders who treat AI contracts as standard software procurement miss the GDPR obligations that flow from AI's unique processing activities. The cost of a GDPR violation — up to €20M or 4% of global annual turnover — makes AI-specific GDPR clause negotiation the highest-ROI privacy investment available.",

A 72-hour vendor obligation leaves zero time for the controller's process.",
      wrongFeedback: "The vendor notification timeline must be shorter than the controller's regulatory notification deadline. With a 72-hour regulatory deadline, a 24-hour vendor notification obligation provides 48 hours for the controller's assessment and notification process — the minimum practical margin.",

      q: "Why must the seven-clause privacy framework be re-reviewed when a vendor pushes a significant model update, not only at contract renewal?",
      options: [
        "Model updates change the contract price and require renegotiation",
        "Model updates may change how personal data is processed — triggering new Article 22 obligations, transfer mechanisms, or breach notification requirements",
        "GDPR requires a new DPA whenever a vendor changes their product",
        "Model updates void the existing SLA and require a new performance baseline",
      ],
      correct: 1,
      correctFeedback: "Correct. A model update that introduces a new processing activity (e.g., real-time profiling), changes the data inputs processed, or alters the AI's decision-making scope may change the GDPR compliance requirements — including Article 22 applicability, transfer obligations, and breach notification scope — independently of the contract renewal cycle.",
      wrongFeedback: "The seven-clause framework must be reviewed at every material change to the AI's personal data processing — not only at contract renewal. A model update that adds new personal data processing activities changes the GDPR compliance picture and may require DPA amendment, Article 22 reassessment, or transfer mechanism review.",
