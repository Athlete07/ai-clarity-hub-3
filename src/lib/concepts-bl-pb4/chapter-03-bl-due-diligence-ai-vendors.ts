  summary:
    "AI vendor due diligence has five dimensions that standard software due diligence misses: model governance, training data provenance, output liability, AI safety practices, and regulatory compliance posture. Business leaders who complete all five dimensions before contract signature avoid the legal, reputational, and operational failures that make AI procurement headline news.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Standard vendor due diligence checks financial stability, security certification, and reference quality. AI vendor due diligence must also verify how the model was trained, who is liable for wrong outputs, what the vendor's AI safety practices are, and whether the vendor's regulatory compliance posture matches your jurisdiction. These five additional checks are what separates a safe AI procurement from a liability exposure.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: when an AI vendor's output harms a customer, causes a regulatory violation, or generates a discriminatory decision, the question your board and regulator will ask is not 'did the vendor do due diligence?' — it is 'what due diligence did you do before signing?' Your due diligence record is your protection.",
