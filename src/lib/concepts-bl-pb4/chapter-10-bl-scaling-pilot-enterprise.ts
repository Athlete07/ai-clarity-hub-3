  summary:
    "The distance from a successful AI pilot to an enterprise-wide deployment is longer and more treacherous than most business leaders anticipate. Performance does not automatically scale, adoption does not automatically propagate, and the vendor relationship that served a 20-person pilot team will not automatically serve a 2,000-person enterprise deployment. Business leaders who understand the six scaling dimensions — technical, operational, organisational, financial, governance, and vendor — can manage the transition from pilot success to enterprise value.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Scaling an AI pilot to enterprise deployment requires decisions in six dimensions simultaneously: technical scaling (infrastructure and integration at volume), operational scaling (workflow redesign at enterprise scope), organisational scaling (change management for large populations), financial scaling (business case validation at scale), governance scaling (monitoring and oversight at enterprise level), and vendor scaling (contract terms and support that match enterprise requirements). Missing any dimension produces a scaling failure — even when the pilot was successful.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: a successful pilot is evidence that the AI can work in a controlled environment. Enterprise scaling is the programme that makes the AI work in an uncontrolled environment — across functions, geographies, and user populations that the pilot never encountered. Budget, plan, and govern the scale as a separate initiative from the pilot.",

Six failure modes account for most AI enterprise scaling failures: performance degradation at volume, integration complexity at enterprise scale, adoption collapse beyond the pilot team, governance gaps revealed by enterprise scope, contract terms designed for pilots not enterprises, and organisational change management underestimated by orders of magnitude.",

The critical step is connecting outputs to outcomes — without this connection, volume metrics cannot demonstrate value.",

      q: "Which enterprise AI change management element is most consistently under-invested and most predictive of adoption success?",
      options: [
        "Role-specific training programmes tailored to each user type",
        "Visible leadership alignment — senior leaders publicly demonstrating AI adoption in their own workflows",
        "Adoption incentive programmes linked to individual performance reviews",
        "Vendor-provided training materials and certification programmes",
      ],
      correct: 1,
      correctFeedback: "Correct. Visible leadership adoption is the most consistently under-invested and most powerful adoption driver. If senior leaders visibly use and endorse the AI, the message to the organisation is that adoption is an expectation. If leaders are absent from the adoption programme, the implicit message is that adoption is optional.",
      wrongFeedback: "Leadership alignment — visible, public AI adoption by senior leaders — is the most consistently under-invested adoption driver and the most powerful signal the organisation receives about whether adoption is an expectation or a preference. Role-specific training, incentives, and vendor materials are valuable but secondary to leadership alignment.",

      q: "A business leader's 90-day enterprise AI review finds that actual ROI is 3.4× versus the projected 3.9×. What is the correct communication approach?",
      options: [
        "Do not report the shortfall — wait until the 180-day review to see if performance improves",
        "Report the reforecast with an explanation of the variance and a mitigation plan for closing the gap",
        "Adjust the original business case projection retrospectively to match the actual outcome",
        "Terminate the deployment and restart the pilot to recalibrate expectations",
      ],
      correct: 1,
      correctFeedback: "Correct. Transparent reporting of the reforecast with a variance explanation and mitigation plan builds more board credibility than suppressing the variance. A downward revision with an explanation demonstrates management rigour. Suppressing or adjusting the projection retrospectively undermines the credibility of all future reporting.",
      wrongFeedback: "The correct approach is transparent reporting of the variance with an explanation and mitigation plan. CFOs and boards consistently report that a downward revision with context is more credible than undisclosed variance or retrospective projection adjustment. Transparency about performance — including underperformance — is the foundation of AI programme credibility.",
