  summary:
    "The AI vendor market is not one market — it is fifteen overlapping submarkets organised by business function, each with different maturity curves, pricing models, and integration requirements. Business leaders who map vendors by function before issuing an RFP cut evaluation time in half and avoid shortlisting tools that cannot meet their operating context.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Map AI vendors to the function they serve — sales, finance, HR, operations, customer service, legal, marketing — before comparing features. A vendor that leads in sales intelligence is architecturally unsuited for finance compliance automation. Functional mapping is the first filter that saves months of wasted evaluation.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: you are not buying AI — you are buying a specific capability for a specific function. Until you map vendors to functions, every demo looks equally impressive and every contract carries equal risk.",
