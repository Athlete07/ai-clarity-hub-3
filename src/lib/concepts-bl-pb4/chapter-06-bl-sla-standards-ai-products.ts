  summary:
    "Standard SLAs cover uptime, response time, and support tiers. AI product SLAs must additionally cover model accuracy, inference latency, output quality degradation, and AI-specific incident categories that do not exist in traditional software. Business leaders who apply standard SLA frameworks to AI deployments accept unmeasured quality risk and receive credits only when the system is down — not when the system is up but producing wrong answers.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "An AI product can have 99.9% uptime and simultaneously have a model that has drifted from 92% accuracy to 74% accuracy — delivering wrong outputs reliably rather than no outputs occasionally. Standard uptime SLAs cannot detect this failure. AI SLAs require accuracy thresholds, inference latency standards, output quality monitoring, and incident categories that address AI-specific failure modes alongside traditional availability metrics.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: the SLA in your AI contract determines what you measure, what the vendor is accountable for, and what compensation you receive when the AI fails. An AI with an excellent uptime SLA and no accuracy SLA is a vendor who is accountable for the lights being on — not for the AI doing its job.",

Standard SLAs are necessary but fundamentally insufficient for AI quality governance.",
      why: "Business leaders who deploy AI with only standard SLAs are measuring the wrong thing. An AI that is always available and always fast but consistently wrong is a liability, not an asset. AI SLAs must measure what the system does, not just whether it is running.",
