  summary:
    "A standard procurement RFP fails for AI vendors because AI capabilities are not comparable on a features checklist — they require live demonstrations, reference architecture reviews, and pilot commitments. Business leaders who adapt the RFP process for AI compress evaluation timelines, surface real capabilities rather than sales claims, and arrive at contract negotiation with evidence rather than hope.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "An AI RFP has three stages standard RFPs lack: a functional requirements brief that replaces a generic scope of work, a live capability demonstration that replaces a written response, and a pilot commitment that replaces a reference check. These three additions convert an AI RFP from a marketing exercise into a procurement instrument.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: an AI vendor's written RFP response is a marketing document. The only signal that matters is what the vendor can demonstrate on your data, in your environment, with your use case. Design your RFP to force this demonstration.",
