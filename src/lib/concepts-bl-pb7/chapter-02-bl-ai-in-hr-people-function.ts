  summary:
    "AI in HR spans recruiting, learning, engagement, and workforce planning. The function that most directly affects people's lives and livelihoods carries the highest ethical and regulatory stakes for AI deployment. CHROs who understand this lead transformation responsibly — and avoid the employment law, bias, and trust failures that define cautionary tales.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "HR AI delivers measurable value in three zones: talent acquisition efficiency, learning personalisation, and workforce analytics. The CHRO's governance mandate is ensuring every AI-assisted people decision maintains human accountability, meets anti-discrimination law, and earns employee trust rather than eroding it.",
