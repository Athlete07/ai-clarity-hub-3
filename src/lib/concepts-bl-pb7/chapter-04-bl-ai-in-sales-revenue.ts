  summary:
    "AI is restructuring sales from a largely intuition-driven activity to a data-informed discipline — improving lead quality, forecast accuracy, and rep productivity. Revenue leaders who understand which AI capabilities deliver durable advantage and which create noise will build sales organisations that outperform on pipeline quality, not just activity volume.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI in sales creates compounding value in three areas: lead scoring and prioritisation, pipeline forecasting accuracy, and sales rep enablement. The revenue leader's governance task is ensuring AI improves conversion quality — not just activity metrics — while maintaining the human relationship that closes complex deals.",
