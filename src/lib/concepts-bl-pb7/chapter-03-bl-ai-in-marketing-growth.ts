  summary:
    "AI is restructuring marketing from campaign-based to continuous, from segment-based to individual, and from intuition-driven to data-driven. CMOs who understand where AI delivers durable advantage versus where it commoditises outputs will allocate budgets more precisely and build marketing capability that compounds over time.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI in marketing creates value in three compounding areas: hyper-personalisation at scale, content production velocity, and predictive customer analytics. The CMO's governance task is ensuring AI amplifies brand differentiation rather than producing generic, algorithmically indistinguishable content.",
