  readingMinutes: 25,
  summary:
    "AI transformation measurement is both the most important and most poorly executed discipline in enterprise AI programmes. Business leaders who establish rigorous measurement — baselines before deployment, outcome metrics over activity metrics, and portfolio-level reporting — make better investment decisions, earn board credibility, and build transformation programmes that compound. Those who measure activity instead of outcomes pay AI costs without building AI value.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI transformation measurement requires four disciplines: baseline measurement before deployment, outcome metrics over activity metrics, attribution rigour that separates AI contribution from confounding factors, and portfolio-level governance that tracks progress across all functions simultaneously. Business leaders who apply all four build transformation programmes that boards can confidently invest in.",
