  summary:
    "Operations and supply chain AI delivers some of the largest and most measurable ROI in the enterprise — in demand forecasting, inventory optimisation, predictive maintenance, and logistics. Operations leaders who deploy AI with rigorous integration and change management build operational advantage that is difficult for competitors to replicate.",

    "AI in operations creates compounding advantage in three zones: demand and inventory intelligence, predictive asset management, and supply chain resilience. The COO's governance task is ensuring AI-generated operational decisions are actioned with appropriate human oversight — particularly when models encounter conditions outside their training distribution.",
