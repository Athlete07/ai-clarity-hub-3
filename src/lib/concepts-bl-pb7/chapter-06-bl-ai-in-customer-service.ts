  summary:
    "AI is restructuring customer service from a cost centre to a value driver — reducing cost per contact while improving resolution speed and service consistency. Leaders who understand which service interactions AI handles well and which require human empathy will build service models that are both efficient and trusted.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI in customer service delivers measurable value in automated resolution, agent assistance, and analytics. The service leader's governance task is ensuring AI escalates correctly to humans, maintains honesty about its AI nature, and never creates the perception that the organisation is hiding humans behind automation to avoid service costs.",
