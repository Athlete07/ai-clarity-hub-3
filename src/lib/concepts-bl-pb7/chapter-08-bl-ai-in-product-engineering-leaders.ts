  readingMinutes: 25,
  summary:
    "AI is transforming product and engineering functions in two distinct ways: as a productivity tool for engineering teams and as a feature capability in the products they build. Product and engineering leaders who understand both dimensions can accelerate development velocity and build differentiated AI products — while governing the technical, quality, and ethical risks that each dimension introduces.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Product and engineering AI leadership requires managing two parallel agendas: AI-assisted development (code generation, testing, documentation) and AI-powered products (ML features, LLM integration, agent capabilities). The CPO and CTO who govern both with equal rigour build faster teams and better products.",
