  summary:
    "AI transformation creates interdependencies between functions that siloed approaches cannot resolve. Data that HR needs exists in Finance; infrastructure that Marketing needs is built by Engineering; governance that Operations needs is owned by Legal. Business leaders who understand and manage these cross-functional dependencies accelerate transformation; those who do not create expensive redundancies and governance gaps.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI transformation is not a function-by-function activity — it is an enterprise coordination challenge. The most expensive AI transformation failures result not from poor technology choices but from unmanaged cross-functional dependencies in data, infrastructure, governance, and change management.",
