  readingMinutes: 25,
  summary:
    "AI is transforming legal and compliance from reactive functions into proactive intelligence operations — faster contract review, more comprehensive regulatory monitoring, and AI-assisted research that frees legal professionals for high-value judgment work. General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officers who govern AI effectively in their functions also become the organisation's AI governance architects.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI in legal and compliance delivers value in contract intelligence, regulatory monitoring, legal research, and compliance management. The General Counsel's dual mandate is deploying AI to accelerate the function's work — while providing the governance framework that makes every other function's AI deployment legally defensible.",
