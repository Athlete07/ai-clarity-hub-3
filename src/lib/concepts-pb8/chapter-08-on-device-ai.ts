  summary:
    "Bringing models to the hardware — the technical and product shift that moves AI off the cloud and onto the device in your user's pocket",
  keyTakeaway:
    "On-device AI runs inference locally on NPUs and mobile silicon — trading model capability for privacy, offline reliability, and sub-100ms latency. PMs who map features to the hybrid edge-cloud split, plan OTA model updates, and position privacy as product story — not just engineering constraint — unlock differentiated experiences competitors can't copy with API calls alone.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: on-device isn't 'run the cloud model on a phone.' It's accepting a smaller model with a narrower capability ceiling in exchange for data never leaving the device. Ship on-device when privacy, offline, or latency is the primary user value — not when you need frontier reasoning on every query.",

Input stays on device, inference runs on local CPU/GPU/NPU, output returns immediately.

The tradeoff: device memory, compute, and battery constrain model size and capability versus cloud frontier models.",
