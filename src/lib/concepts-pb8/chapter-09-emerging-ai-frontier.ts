  summary:
    "The frontier that will define the next generation of AI products — what's already here, what's arriving, and how to build strategy around deep uncertainty",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Reasoning models trade latency for accuracy on hard tasks; world models enable physical planning and robotics; long-context and multimodal reasoning unlock new product categories. PMs who make scenario-based roadmap bets, build modular architectures that swap models, and avoid overcommitting to today's limitations — or ignoring tomorrow's capabilities — navigate frontier uncertainty better than competitors chasing every launch announcement.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: don't replatform your product every time OpenAI ships a new model. Build eval infrastructure, modular routing, and scenario-based roadmaps so you can adopt reasoning models, world models, and agentic capabilities when they cross your quality gate — not when the press release drops.",
