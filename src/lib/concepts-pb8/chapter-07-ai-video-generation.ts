  summary:
    "The frontier capability reshaping content creation — what AI video generation can do now, what it can't, and how to build products around it responsibly",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI video generation extends diffusion to the temporal dimension — text-to-video is impressive but inconsistent; image-to-video is the production-ready sweet spot. PMs who gate launches on consistency metrics, build provenance and consent infrastructure, and map use cases to maturity tiers avoid the deepfake reputational cliff.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: don't ship AI video generation because the demo looked cinematic. Ship when image-to-video consistency passes your golden set, moderation catches synthetic likeness abuse, and legal has signed off on training-data and commercial-rights posture for your vendor stack.",
