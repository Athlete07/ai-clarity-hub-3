  summary:
    "How transformers moved from language to images — and why the same architecture that reads text now understands what it sees",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Vision Transformers treat image patches as tokens and run the same attention mechanism that powers LLMs — unifying vision and language under one architectural family. For PMs, the practical shift is that image understanding is now an API capability (VLMs) with predictable failure modes, not a bespoke CNN pipeline per use case. Ship vision features when the user problem is inherently visual — documents, charts, photos, UI screenshots — and budget for hallucination on spatial reasoning and fine detail.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: don't spec 'computer vision' as a separate engineering track unless you have a narrow, high-volume classification task. Most product teams should evaluate vision-language APIs on golden image sets — document parsing, chart QA, product photo search — and treat ViT/VLM capability as a bought layer with eval gates, not a research project.",
