  summary:
    "The UX and architecture patterns that work when your product takes in or produces more than one modality at once",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Multimodal products fail when teams treat modalities as independent features stapled together. The PM job is to design coherent flows: pick input and output modalities per task, ground model outputs back to source regions, budget latency across encoding pipelines, and specify degradation when any modality fails. The highest-ROI multimodal pattern in enterprise today is document understanding — vision plus language on PDFs, slides, and forms.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: every modality you add multiplies latency, cost, moderation surface, and failure modes. Support a modality only when it clearly beats text for the user's job — not because the model can technically accept it.",
