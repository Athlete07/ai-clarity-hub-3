  summary:
    "The voice layer of AI products — how machines listen and speak, and what production-grade audio AI actually requires",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Speech-to-text converts audio waveforms to text; text-to-speech converts text back to natural audio — together they form the perception and voice layers of voice AI products. For PMs, shipping voice means choosing batch vs streaming STT, planning diarisation and multilingual gaps, selecting neural TTS with persona and consent policies, and budgeting end-to-end latency across the STT → LLM → TTS stack. Voice is a UX contract measured in milliseconds and trust, not demo accuracy on quiet studio recordings.",

    "As a PM: never demo voice in a quiet conference room and ship to a warehouse floor. Golden audio eval must include noise, accents, overlap, and domain vocabulary — and you need explicit consent flows before any voice cloning feature touches production.",
