  summary:
    "Designing AI products people talk to — the interaction model, UX patterns, and reliability constraints that make voice hard to ship well",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Voice interfaces are not chat with audio — they're an eyes-free, hands-free modality with no undo, no scan-back, and brutal latency sensitivity. The production pattern is almost always multimodal: voice in, screen out. PMs who ship voice must own the full stack budget (STT → LLM → TTS), persona design, barge-in behaviour, and error recovery — because users blame the product, not the pipeline, when the assistant mishears.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: if your voice feature can't recover gracefully from a misheard command in under 3 seconds, users will stop talking and start tapping. Voice is a trust game — one bad loop kills adoption faster than ten bad chat messages.",

Cognitive load is higher for dense information; memory of spoken lists fades in seconds. Design must favour short utterances, confirmation loops, and progressive disclosure.",
