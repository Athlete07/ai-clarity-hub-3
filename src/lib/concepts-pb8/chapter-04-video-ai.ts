  summary:
    "The hardest modality — what models can do with moving images today and where the capability frontier actually sits",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Video AI compounds every difficulty of image AI with time — temporal coherence, compute scale, and data hunger. PMs who treat video as 'images plus frames' underestimate cost and overestimate quality. Map features to maturity tiers: perception and search are production-ready; generation and long-form reasoning are emerging; character consistency across minutes is still research-grade.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: before you scope a video feature, answer three questions — how many frames per second of understanding, what happens when the model misreads motion, and whether users need generation or comprehension. Most video roadmaps fail because they conflate all three.",
