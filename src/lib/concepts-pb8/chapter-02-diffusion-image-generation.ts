  summary:
    "How modern image generation actually works — the probabilistic process behind Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Diffusion models learn to reverse a noise corruption process — starting from random pixels and iteratively denoising toward a coherent image guided by your prompt. For PMs, image generation is a product surface with sharp tradeoffs: model choice (aesthetic vs controllable vs open-weight), guidance and step parameters, conditioning beyond text (ControlNet, reference images), legal exposure on training data and deepfakes, and moderation requirements that must be designed before launch — not bolted on after a PR crisis.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: treat image generation like user-generated content at infinite scale — every pixel is a liability and a delight. Ship with blocklists, provenance metadata, human review for public-facing outputs, and explicit brand policy on style mimicry. The demo is easy; responsible product is hard.",

At inference, it starts from random noise and iteratively denoises — guided by a text embedding — into a coherent image.",
