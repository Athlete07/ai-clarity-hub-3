  summary:
    "Most founders evaluate AI vendors on demos. Demos are designed to impress, not inform. Vendor landscape, rigorous RFPs, meaningful pilots, SLA standards, data privacy, pricing traps, and a weighted scorecard before you sign.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Treat AI vendor selection like hiring a co-founder you cannot easily fire. Run structured evaluation with your data, your edge cases, and your lawyer — not the vendor's demo environment.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: the demo that wowed you used curated inputs, optimal model settings, and a sales engineer behind the curtain. Your job is to design evaluation that fails vendors who cannot survive your real workload.",
