  summary:
    "Three paths to customising AI behaviour — prompts, RAG, and fine-tuning — with completely different cost structures. Honest cost comparison, decision tree, hybrid architectures, and how to lead the engineering conversation without faking technical depth.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Start with prompts, escalate to RAG when knowledge is the gap, escalate to fine-tune when behaviour is the gap — and only combine when measured evals prove each layer earns its cost. Capital follows the failure mode, not the demo frustration.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: if your team says 'we need to fine-tune' before they have exhausted prompts and RAG on a golden eval set, you are funding engineering preference, not product evidence. Ask for the eval numbers, not the architecture diagram.",
