  summary:
    "Every AI startup building on third-party APIs rents its core capability. Price increases, deprecations, terms changes, and vendors becoming competitors — mapped with exit architecture and a dependency risk register.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "API dependency is not a technical detail — it is a balance-sheet risk. Model your vendor scenarios at 3× pricing, architect for portability from day one, and maintain a scored risk register your board reviews quarterly.",

    "As a founder: if a single vendor pricing email could wipe out your gross margin, you do not have a product strategy — you have a vendor subsidy strategy. Map dependencies before investors map them for you in diligence.",
