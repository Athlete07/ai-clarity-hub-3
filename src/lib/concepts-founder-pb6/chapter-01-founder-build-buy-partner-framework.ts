  summary:
    "The decision most founders make on instinct — training, fine-tuning, APIs, white-label, acqui-hire, and partnerships — should be made on analysis. Five axes, three-year TCO, and a reversibility test before you commit runway.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Build, buy, and partner are not three equal options — they are three capital allocation paths with different moat, speed, and exit costs. Document the decision before engineering commits; most durable AI products buy the base, partner for data, and build the product system around both.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: never let 'we'll use GPT' or 'we'll train our own model' be the first sentence in your strategy deck. Start with what must be differentiated, what data you own, what happens if the vendor doubles price, and which path you can undo in ninety days.",
