  summary:
    "Everything surfaces in due diligence — technical, data, liability, and team reviews, plus the data room and self-audit to run six months before you raise.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Investors hire specialists to find what you did not disclose. Technical architecture, data provenance, AI liability, and team capability all get examined. Pre-empt findings with a six-month self-audit — or accept valuation adjustments at the term sheet.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: run the same diligence on yourself that investors will run on you. If you would not invest given what you find, fix it before you pitch — not after the term sheet.",
