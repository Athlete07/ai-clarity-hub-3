  summary:
    "Why two companies with the same revenue get completely different multiples — what the AI premium actually is, what earns it, and how to negotiate valuation on defensibility rather than hype.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The AI premium is an investor bet on compounding defensibility — data moat, loop velocity, improvement rate, and switching costs. API wrappers and chatbot features do not earn it; honest self-assessment before fundraising saves months of mismatched expectations.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: run the premium scorecard before you name a valuation. If you cannot credibly claim all four justification factors, you are pitching SaaS multiples — and should price the round accordingly to avoid a down round later.",
