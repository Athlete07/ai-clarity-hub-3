  title: "Build, Buy, or Partner — The Business Leader's AI Sourcing Decision",
  readingMinutes: 22,
  summary:
    "Every AI initiative requires a sourcing decision: build it internally, buy a vendor solution, or partner with a specialist. The wrong choice burns budget, time, and organisational credibility. This chapter gives business leaders the framework to make this decision rationally and defend it with finance, technology, and the board.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Build when AI is the source of your competitive differentiation and you have the data moat to justify it. Buy when proven solutions exist and the value is in adoption, not novelty. Partner when you need speed and specialist capability you cannot build or buy as a whole. Hybrid is usually the reality — the question is which dimension you own and which you outsource.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: the build-buy-partner decision is a capital allocation decision, not a technology preference. Own the criteria, understand the cost structures, and make the call before the technology team makes it for you.",

In practice, most enterprise AI is a hybrid of all three.",
