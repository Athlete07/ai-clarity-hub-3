  title: "Stakeholder Management and AI Politics — The Game Beneath the Governance",
  readingMinutes: 20,
  summary:
    "AI programmes succeed or fail in governance meetings — but they win or lose in corridors, one-on-ones, and the informal conversations that shape what gets funded, what gets blocked, and who gets heard. Business leaders who manage only the formal governance of AI programmes manage the visible game. Those who also manage the political dynamics beneath it win both.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI politics are not a corruption of good governance — they are the reality of every significant organisational investment. Business leaders who recognise stakeholder dynamics, manage key relationships, convert blockers, and build coalitions produce better outcomes than equally intelligent leaders who assume good evidence speaks for itself. Evidence speaks; politics determines whether it is heard.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: political capital for AI investment is earned through credibility, trust, and track record — and spent on the decisions that matter most. Manage it deliberately, spend it strategically, and replenish it continuously through transparent governance and delivered commitments.",
