  title: "Aligning AI with Business Strategy — Why Most AI Programmes Drift and How to Anchor Yours",
  readingMinutes: 20,
  summary:
    "AI investment that is not anchored to business strategy produces technically interesting outcomes that do not move the metrics that matter. This chapter shows business leaders how to create and sustain the connection between AI investment decisions and the organisation's competitive priorities — and how to communicate that connection to every stakeholder audience.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI is not a strategy — it is an enabler of strategies that are already sound. Every AI investment must trace its value chain to a stated competitive priority or customer outcome. The leaders who establish and maintain this connection govern programmes that deliver; the ones who let AI become its own strategic direction govern programmes that drift.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: strategic alignment is your responsibility, not the technology team's. They will solve the problem you give them — the question is whether you gave them the right problem. Set the strategic anchor before the initiative is designed.",
