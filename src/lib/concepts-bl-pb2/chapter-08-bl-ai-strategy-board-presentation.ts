  readingMinutes: 20,
  summary:
    "Board AI presentations fail when they lead with technology and end with a funding request that the board cannot evaluate on their own terms. This chapter gives business leaders the structure, language, and preparation to present AI strategy as a capital allocation decision that the board can evaluate, approve, and govern — and that produces sustained investment rather than one-off approval.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Boards approve AI investment when it is presented as a business capital allocation decision with comprehensible returns, clear risk management, and credible governance. They resist it when it feels like a technology enthusiasm that requires trust they have not yet earned. The business leader's job is to make AI feel like the former before the presentation starts.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: the board presentation is your accountability moment. You are asking for sustained investment on the basis of your judgment about strategic priorities. Present with the specificity you would want if you were on the other side of the table.",
