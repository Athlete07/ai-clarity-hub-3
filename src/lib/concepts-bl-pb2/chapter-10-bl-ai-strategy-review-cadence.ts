  title: "AI Strategy Review Cadence — Governing a Programme That Never Stands Still",
  readingMinutes: 20,
  summary:
    "AI strategies become obsolete faster than software roadmaps because model capabilities, vendor markets, regulatory requirements, and competitive conditions all evolve on timescales shorter than the annual planning cycle. Business leaders who review AI strategy on an annual cadence govern a programme that is systematically behind reality. This chapter gives you the governance architecture for a programme that stays current.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI governance requires a nested cadence: monthly operational monitoring to detect performance drift, quarterly portfolio reviews to make gate and priority decisions, and annual strategic alignment to ensure the portfolio still serves the right business outcomes. Each cadence has different decisions, different participants, and different artefacts — treating all three the same produces governance that is either too frequent to be strategic or too infrequent to catch operational drift.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: you own the quarterly portfolio review and the annual strategic alignment — these are the cadences that determine whether your AI programme stays connected to business strategy. The monthly operational reviews can be delegated; the quarterly and annual ones cannot.",

      subtitle: "The four dynamics that make annual review insufficient",
      take: "Annual review cadence is designed for stable investment programmes — infrastructure, real estate, long-term capital equipment. AI investment is not stable: model capabilities evolve quarterly, vendor markets shift through acquisitions and pricing changes, regulatory guidance is issued in response to deployments, and competitive AI adoption creates urgency that does not wait for annual review windows. Leaders who review AI annually make decisions 12 months after the evidence that should drive them.",
      why: "Understanding why AI needs a faster cadence prevents the governance trap of importing annual planning conventions into a domain where they systematically produce late decisions. The case for a faster cadence is not about busyness — it is about the decision latency that annual cadence produces.",
