  title: "Prioritising AI by ROI — Why It Is Hard and How to Do It Anyway",
  readingMinutes: 20,
  summary:
    "AI ROI is genuinely harder to calculate than conventional IT investment — but business leaders who refuse to engage with the calculation end up with unfundable programmes or unaccountable pilots. This chapter gives you a scoring model, a portfolio framework, and the discipline to say no.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "ROI prioritisation for AI requires a consistent scoring model applied across all candidates, time-to-value discipline to prevent long-horizon thinking from crowding out near-term returns, and the governance to say no to good ideas that do not make the portfolio. Leaders who master this present AI as a capital allocation decision, not a technology gamble.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: ROI prioritisation is your most important AI governance tool. It converts 'should we do AI?' from a cultural debate to a resource allocation discipline. Own the model, apply it consistently, and defend the no's as vigorously as the yes's.",

Leaders who understand why it is hard can design models that work despite the difficulty.",
