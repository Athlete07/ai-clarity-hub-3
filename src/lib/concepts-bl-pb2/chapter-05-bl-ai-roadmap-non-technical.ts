  readingMinutes: 20,
  summary:
    "An AI roadmap is not a technology project plan — it is a sequenced business commitment that connects AI investment to business outcomes over a defined time horizon. Business leaders who own their AI roadmap are more credible with boards, more effective with technology partners, and more successful at delivering value than those who delegate roadmap ownership to technical teams.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI roadmaps differ from software roadmaps in four critical ways: they require data foundations before they require features, they must be governed by outcomes not deliverables, they fail at the change management layer more often than the technology layer, and they demand quarterly review rather than annual refresh. Own the outcomes; let the technology team own the implementation.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: your job is to own the roadmap's business logic — the sequence of bets, the outcome gates, the dependency order, and the board narrative. The technology team owns the technical delivery. That division of labour is how AI roadmaps succeed.",
