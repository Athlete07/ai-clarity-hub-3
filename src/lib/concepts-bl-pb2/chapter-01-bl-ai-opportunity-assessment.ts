  summary:
    "Before any vendor call or pilot budget, business leaders need a structured method to identify where AI will genuinely create value — and rule out the areas where it will not. This chapter gives you that method.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Opportunity assessment is a filter, not a brainstorm. Work from business problems backward to AI capabilities, score by value and feasibility together, and only then shortlist for pilots. The leaders who skip this step fund demos; the leaders who do it fund outcomes.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: your job is to own the prioritised shortlist — not to understand AI architectures. Every tool in this chapter produces a decision artefact you can defend to your CFO, your CTO, and your board.",
