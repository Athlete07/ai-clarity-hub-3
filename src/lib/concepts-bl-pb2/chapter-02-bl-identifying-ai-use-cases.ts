  summary:
    "Use case identification is where most AI programmes go wrong — either they stop at the obvious and miss high-value opportunities, or they chase glamorous transformations and miss quick wins that could fund the journey. This chapter gives business leaders a structured method to build a complete, validated use case inventory.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Great AI use cases are found by systematically mapping your functions against three archetypes, stress-testing with data availability and effort-frequency analysis, and resisting the glamour trap. The output is a validated inventory your team owns and can defend — not a vendor shortlist.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: use case identification is where you earn the right to a budget conversation. Walk into it with a structured inventory and you are managing a portfolio. Walk in with a technology wish list and you are funding experiments with no accountability.",
