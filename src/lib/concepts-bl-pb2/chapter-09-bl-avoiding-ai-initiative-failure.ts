  summary:
    "AI initiative failure rates are high — consistently estimated at 70-80% of enterprise AI projects that fail to deliver on their original business case. This chapter examines the eight most consistent failure patterns and gives business leaders the diagnostic tools to identify and interrupt them before they consume budget and credibility.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Most AI initiative failures are not technology failures — they are governance, strategy, data, change management, and leadership failures that happen to involve technology. Business leaders who understand the failure patterns can prevent most of them. The ones they cannot prevent, they can detect early and respond to before the failure becomes a write-off.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a business leader: your job is to be the early warning system for the failure patterns that technology teams cannot see — change resistance, strategic drift, vendor dependency, and leadership disengagement. These are the failures only you can prevent.",
