  readingMinutes: 26,
  summary:
    "The US regulatory environment is fragmented, fast-moving, and consequential — federal executive orders and NIST framework, FTC enforcement, sector regulators, state patchwork, emerging AI liability law, and how founders stay current without becoming compliance lawyers.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "US AI regulation is not one law — it is federal guidance, FTC enforcement, sector rules, and state legislation operating simultaneously. Founders who map sector and state exposure for each feature avoid the 'we'll comply when there's a federal law' trap that has already caught companies in FTC actions and state penalties.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: there is no single US AI law coming to save you from complexity. Map federal + sector + state exposure per feature now — or discover it in an FTC inquiry, EEOC investigation, or Colorado compliance audit.",
