  summary:
    "When hallucination and bias become legal liability — real cases, discrimination law applied to AI, disparate impact standards, terms of service limits, AI liability insurance, and the briefing document for your general counsel conversation.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Hallucination is confident fiction at scale; bias is memorized prejudice at scale. Neither is eliminable — but founders who treat them as legal and regulatory risks before launch build containment architecture. Founders who treat them as engineering bugs discover them in lawsuits, settlements, and regulatory actions.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: 'the model hallucinated' is not a legal defence. 'We took reasonable care and here is the documentation' is. Build the documentation before you need it in court.",
