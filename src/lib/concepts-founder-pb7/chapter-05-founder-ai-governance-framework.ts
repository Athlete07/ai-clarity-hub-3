  summary:
    "What AI governance actually is, the minimum viable governance stack for startups, red-teaming, human oversight design, audit trails, incident response, responsible AI as a sales asset, and the quarterly board governance report.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI governance is not a policy PDF nobody reads — it is the operational system that lets you ship AI safely, close enterprise deals, survive diligence, and recover from incidents. Founders who build governance before scale move faster at scale; founders who defer it move fast once and then stop.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: your governance framework is the document enterprise buyers, investors, and your board all ask for — and your competitors probably do not have. Build it before your first enterprise deal, not after your first incident.",
