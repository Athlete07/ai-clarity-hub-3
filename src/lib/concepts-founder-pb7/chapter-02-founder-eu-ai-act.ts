  summary:
    "The most significant AI regulation in history is already law — timeline, scope, four risk tiers, high-risk obligations, foundation model provisions, penalties up to 7% of global turnover, and the minimum viable compliance posture for startups selling to Europe.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The EU AI Act applies to you if EU users touch your AI — regardless of HQ location. Founders who map features to risk tiers at ideation choose markets deliberately; founders who discover high-risk classification mid-deal lose nine months and six figures in compliance rework.",
  pmCallout:
