  summary:
    "What can go wrong, how fast it goes wrong, and who is holding the bag — the four risk categories every founder must map, why startups underestimate them, and how to calibrate risk proportionally before your board asks.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI risk is not one thing — it is technical, legal, reputational, and regulatory risk interacting on a compressed timeline. Founders who document and own their risk register before launch survive incidents; founders who treat risk as an engineering backlog discover it in press coverage and investor calls.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: your AI product can fail in four different ways simultaneously — and you are personally accountable for all of them. Map your risk register before your first enterprise deal, not after your first lawsuit.",
