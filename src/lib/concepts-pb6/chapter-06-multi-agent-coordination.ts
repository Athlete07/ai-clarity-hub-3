  summary:
    "When one agent isn't enough — orchestrator-worker patterns, peer networks, specialised roles, inter-agent communication, supervisor agents, loop prevention, trust boundaries, and debugging agent teams. The PM framework for when multi-agent complexity pays off.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Multi-agent systems trade coordination overhead for parallelism and specialisation. They win when tasks decompose cleanly; they lose when a single well-tooled agent would suffice. PMs apply the simpler-system test before funding agent teams.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: every additional agent is another hiring line on an org chart — with the same risk of miscommunication. Ask 'could one agent with better tools do this?' before approving a multi-agent architecture.",
