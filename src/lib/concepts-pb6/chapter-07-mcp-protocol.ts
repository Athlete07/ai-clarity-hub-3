  summary:
    "Model Context Protocol — the open standard that lets agents discover and use tools, resources, and prompts across systems without bespoke integrations for every pair — client/server architecture, primitives, security, ecosystem growth, and the PM platform decision of whether to expose your product as an MCP server.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "MCP collapses the N×M integration problem between agents and tools into a single protocol — but adoption is a product strategy, not just an eng convenience. PMs who understand MCP primitives and security can decide when standardised agent access is distribution and when it is liability.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: before approving MCP server work, answer three questions — which capabilities do we expose, who authenticates, and what happens when an agent calls delete_customer via our MCP tool at 3am? Protocol standardisation doesn't remove permission design.",
