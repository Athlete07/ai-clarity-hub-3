  summary:
    "The reasoning strategies that let agents tackle complex, multi-step tasks without losing the plot",
  keyTakeaway:
    "ReAct interleaves reasoning and acting so the model thinks before each tool call. Plan-and-execute, self-reflection, decomposition, and replanning add structure for long tasks — at the cost of latency and tokens. PMs choose planning depth based on task complexity, not maximum deliberation by default.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: more reasoning steps mean higher COGS and slower UX. Match planning depth to task stakes and ambiguity — a refund lookup doesn't need tree-of-thought; a migration plan might need plan-and-execute with replanning gates.",
