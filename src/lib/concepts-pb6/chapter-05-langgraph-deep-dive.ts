  summary:
    "LangGraph's graph-based control flow for production agents — nodes, edges, shared state, conditional routing, cycles, human-in-the-loop interrupts, checkpointing, and multi-agent composition. Why teams graduate from linear chains to stateful graphs.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "LangGraph models agents as directed graphs with explicit state — loops, branches, and recovery become first-class instead of fragile prompt hacks. The tradeoff is operational complexity; the payoff is predictable behaviour when agents must retry, escalate, or pause for humans.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: ask for the LangGraph diagram before approving an agent epic — nodes are features, edges are decision rules, state is memory. If the team can't draw it, they're not ready to ship autonomous loops.",
