  summary:
    "Keeping humans in control of autonomous agents — the autonomy-oversight spectrum, interrupt points, approval workflows, escalation design, audit trails, feedback loops, trust calibration UX, progressive autonomy, and the PM liability decisions that make oversight a feature rather than friction.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Human-in-the-loop is not a safety net you add after launch — it is a product architecture choice on the autonomy spectrum. PMs who design interrupt points, approval UX, and escalation paths before agents act make autonomy shippable in high-stakes domains.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: for every agent workflow, document where humans enter, what they see, what actions they can take, and what happens when they disagree with the agent. If oversight feels theatrical — no context, no audit trail — users will bypass it or hate it.",
