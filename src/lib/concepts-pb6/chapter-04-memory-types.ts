  summary:
    "How agents remember — in-context, episodic, semantic, and procedural memory, plus external stores, retrieval strategies, compression, and multi-user isolation. The architecture layer that determines whether an agent feels continuous or amnesiac.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Agent memory is not one thing — it's a stack of systems trading off context window cost, recall accuracy, and infrastructure complexity. PMs who specify memory depth per feature avoid shipping agents that forget mid-task or leak one user's history to another.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: when eng says 'we'll add memory,' ask 'which type, for how long, scoped to whom, and what happens when retrieval pulls the wrong past?' Memory is a product promise, not a checkbox.",
