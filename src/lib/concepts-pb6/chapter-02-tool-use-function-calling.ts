  summary:
    "How agents reach beyond language into the real world — the mechanism that makes agents actually useful",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Tool use gives models the ability to call external functions during a reasoning loop; function calling is the structured interface (schema → model output → execution → result fed back). Every tool is both a capability and a liability — schema design, routing, error handling, and security boundaries are product decisions, not backend details.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: your agent is only as good as its tools. Before adding another API to the toolkit, ask what failure looks like, who can trigger it, and whether the schema will survive contact with real user queries. Tool design is product design.",
