  summary:
    "From single-turn responses to autonomous reasoning — what makes a system an agent and the architectures that determine trust",
  keyTakeaway:
    "An agent is a model that perceives, reasons, decides, and acts across multiple steps — not just responds. The architecture you choose (reflexive, planning, multi-agent, hierarchical) and where you sit on the autonomy spectrum determine reliability, latency, cost, and how much users will trust the system to act on their behalf.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: before you greenlight 'make it an agent,' ask what actions it will take, how wrong it can be before harm occurs, and whether a fixed chain would deliver 90% of the value at 10% of the risk. Agent architecture is a trust contract, not a feature flag.",
