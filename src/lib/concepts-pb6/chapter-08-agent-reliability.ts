  summary:
    "Why agent failures compound across steps — hallucinated tool calls, infinite loops, task drift, irreversible actions, context exhaustion, and retry design — plus simulation-based testing and the PM launch criteria that separate demo agents from production-trustworthy systems.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "A 95% per-step success rate becomes roughly 60% over ten steps — agent reliability is a compounding math problem, not a model quality problem alone. PMs define failure budgets, confirmation gates, and monitoring before autonomy ships.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: never launch an agent without naming the maximum acceptable end-to-end failure rate, the irreversible actions that require human approval, and the metric that triggers a autonomy rollback. 'We'll monitor it' fails when errors compound silently.",
