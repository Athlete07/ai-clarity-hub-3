  summary:
    "Fear and resistance are not signs that an AI transformation is failing — they are normal human responses to genuine uncertainty about the future of work. Leaders who treat fear as an obstacle to be overcome miss the diagnostic value it contains: fear reveals the specific concerns that, if addressed, become adoption catalysts. This chapter provides a structured framework for understanding, categorising, and responding to AI fear and resistance at the individual, team, and organisational levels.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Fear of AI is not irrational — it is a rational response to genuinely uncertain consequences. The leader's job is not to eliminate fear but to address the specific concerns underneath it with honesty, tangible support, and demonstrated respect. Resistance that is dismissed will intensify. Resistance that is understood often converts to the most valuable kind of advocacy.",

Each source requires a different response. A change management programme that treats all resistance as the same problem will address none of these sources effectively.",
