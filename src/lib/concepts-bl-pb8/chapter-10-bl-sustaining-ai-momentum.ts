  readingMinutes: 24,
  summary:
    "AI transformation momentum is harder to sustain than to start. The excitement of early pilots and quick wins gives way to the grinding work of operational integration, the fatigue of continuous change, and the distraction of competing strategic priorities. Business leaders who sustain AI momentum do so through institutional design — governance structures, leadership practices, and organisational habits that make AI advancement the default rather than a continuous act of will.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Sustained AI momentum is not a leadership personality trait — it is an institutional design achievement. Organisations that sustain AI momentum have built the governance, the culture, and the capability development systems that advance AI transformation without requiring heroic individual leadership energy at every stage. The leader's job is to build those systems, not to be the system.",
