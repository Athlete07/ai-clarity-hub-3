  summary:
    "AI communication fails in two predictable ways: overcommunication of capability before proof exists and undercommunication of honest uncertainty that employees are already feeling. Both erode trust. Honest AI communication is not about managing perception — it is about building the foundation of trust that makes genuine adoption possible. This chapter provides a structured communication framework for every stakeholder group and every phase of AI transformation.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The most effective AI communication is specific, honest about uncertainty, differentiated by audience, and consistent in cadence. Leaders who communicate AI progress with specific examples perform better on adoption metrics than leaders who communicate with general enthusiasm. Leaders who acknowledge uncertainty honestly build more durable trust than leaders who project false confidence.",

Both patterns destroy adoption momentum.",
