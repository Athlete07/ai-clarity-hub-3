  summary:
    "Between 70% and 85% of enterprise AI transformation programmes fail to deliver their stated business outcomes. The failures are not technical — they are organisational. Business leaders who understand the five systemic failure modes before launching transformation can design programmes that avoid them. This chapter maps each failure mode to a specific leadership decision that prevents it.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI transformations fail for predictable, preventable reasons: leadership misalignment, technology-first sequencing, underestimating change management, insufficient data infrastructure, and measuring the wrong outcomes. None of these are technical failures. They are leadership failures. The leaders who succeed treat AI transformation as an organisational change programme with a technology component — not a technology project with an organisational component.",
