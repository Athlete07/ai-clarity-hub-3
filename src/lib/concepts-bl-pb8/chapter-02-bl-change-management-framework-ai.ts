  readingMinutes: 30,
  summary:
    "AI transformation is the most complex change management challenge most organisations have encountered — not because the technology is hard, but because AI changes the nature of work itself. Standard change management frameworks were designed for process change. AI requires a framework that addresses identity change, continuous learning, and sustained uncertainty over a multi-year horizon. This chapter provides that framework.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI change management requires three elements that standard change frameworks omit: explicit work on the identity implications of AI augmentation, a structure for managing continuous learning as the technology evolves, and a multi-year change architecture rather than a single-deployment change plan. Leaders who apply ERP-style change management to AI transformation are using the wrong tool.",

      take: "AI change differs from ERP, CRM, and cloud migration change in three fundamental ways: it changes what decisions humans are authorised to make, it renders certain skills obsolete faster than retraining can compensate, and it requires continuous adaptation as the technology itself evolves. A change management framework that does not address these three dimensions will fail on all three.",
      why: "Leaders who treat AI change management as a faster version of ERP change management are applying a framework designed for a different problem. ERP changed processes and tools. AI changes roles, authority, and professional identity. The framework must match the scope of the change.",

The human's decision-making scope narrows.",
            "This scope narrowing is not universally experienced as a loss — many workers welcome the reduction in routine cognitive load. But for workers who derived professional identity from the expertise now automated, the experience is closer to redundancy than productivity improvement.",

        "Correct. Month 10 adoption below target is a common pattern in the messy middle of transformation. A mid-programme review identifies the specific obstacles — which are almost always execution gaps, not programme design flaws. Targeted corrections consistently outperform programme redesigns, which destroy institutional learning and restart the change management cycle from a lower baseline.",

        "43% at month 10 in a transformation planned for 36 months is not programme failure — it is the messy middle. A programme redesign at this stage destroys the institutional learning that has accumulated and restarts the adoption clock. A mid-programme review identifies specific obstacles; targeted corrections address them without abandoning programme direction.",

        "Correct. The setback response sequence prioritises speed of communication over completeness of investigation. Acknowledging within 24 hours — before the investigation is complete — preserves trust. The worst response is silence during investigation followed by defensive communication when findings are available.",
      wrongFeedback:
        "The setback response must start with immediate acknowledgement — even before the investigation is complete. 'We are aware and investigating' is a complete honest response. Silence during investigation is the pattern that damages trust most severely.",

      correctFeedback:
        "Correct. Middle managers are treated as a communication transmission layer — people who pass messages from senior leadership to frontline teams. In reality, they are the primary adoption lever: their day-to-day norms determine whether AI use is expected, optional, or subtly discouraged in their teams. Dedicated middle manager AI programmes consistently outperform general employee programmes in adoption impact.",
      wrongFeedback:
