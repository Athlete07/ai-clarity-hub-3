  summary:
    "When AI augments a role, the role itself changes — not just the tools used in it. The tasks AI performs, the decisions humans retain, and the skills that become more valuable all shift. Business leaders who design this shift deliberately — through structured role anatomy, new job description frameworks, and honest communication of what changes — produce more capable teams and more motivated employees than leaders who allow role change to happen by default.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Role redefinition in the AI-augmented organisation is not a job description update exercise. It is a fundamental redesign of what humans contribute alongside AI — shifting from task execution to outcome ownership, from information retrieval to judgement application, and from individual expertise to collaborative intelligence. Leaders who design this shift create roles that are more rewarding and more productive. Leaders who allow it to happen by default create roles that are less clear and less valued.",
