  summary:
    "Psychological safety — the shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking — is the single most important organisational condition for AI adoption. Without it, employees hide AI mistakes, avoid AI experimentation, and withhold concerns about AI quality. With it, organisations learn faster, adopt more thoroughly, and catch AI failures earlier. Business leaders who build psychological safety do not do it as a cultural aspiration — they do it because it is the fastest path to effective AI adoption.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "In the context of AI transformation, psychological safety means: it is safe to try AI, safe to fail with AI, safe to express concerns about AI, and safe to be a beginner with AI. Leaders create this safety through consistent behaviour — not through values statements. Every time a leader responds to an AI failure with curiosity rather than blame, the safety increases. Every time they respond with blame, the safety decreases.",

      take: "AI adoption failure in psychologically unsafe teams looks like resistance, disengagement, or incompetence — but is actually rational self-protection.
