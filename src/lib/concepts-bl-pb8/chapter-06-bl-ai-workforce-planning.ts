  summary:
    "AI workforce planning is the strategic process of anticipating what capabilities the organisation will need as AI augments its operations, and preparing the people, structures, and pipelines to meet that need. It is not a one-time headcount exercise — it is a continuous capability management process that runs in parallel with AI deployment. Business leaders who invest in AI workforce planning build organisations that adapt to AI capability evolution rather than react to it.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI workforce planning requires four strategic choices: which capabilities to build internally versus acquire externally, how to reskill versus redeploy versus restructure, what AI fluency baseline the entire organisation needs, and how to manage workforce transitions humanely. Leaders who make these choices proactively build resilient organisations. Leaders who make them reactively manage workforce crises.",
