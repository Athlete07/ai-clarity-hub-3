  readingMinutes: 24,
  summary:
    "AI transformation progresses through five recognisable stages: readiness, first pilots, scaling proof points, operational integration, and competitive differentiation. Each stage has distinct milestone criteria that, when met, justify investment in the next stage. Leaders who track milestones against a structured framework make better investment decisions, communicate progress more credibly, and identify programme drift before it becomes programme failure.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Milestone-based AI transformation management replaces the two most common failure patterns: perpetual piloting (never leaving Stage 2) and premature scaling (moving to Stage 3 before Stage 2 milestones are met). The milestone framework creates the discipline to pause, assess, and commit — rather than the cultural pressure to appear to be moving fast.",
