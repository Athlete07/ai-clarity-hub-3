  summary:
    "The market is brutal, the signals are confusing, and most founders get this wrong. Supply and demand, non-technical interviewing, portfolio assessment, take-home design, compensation, and the red flags that sound impressive but slow you down.",

    "You do not need to be technical to hire technical AI talent — you need a structured evaluation framework and honest compensation math.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: every month without a hiring framework is a month your competitor hires the engineer you needed. Structure beats intuition in the AI talent war.",
