  summary:
    "Bias and hallucination are not bugs to patch — they are structural properties of AI systems with legal, regulatory, and reputational consequences. EU AI Act, US disparate-impact law, and the lawyer conversation every founder must have before shipping.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Bias is memorized prejudice at scale; hallucination is confident fiction at scale. You cannot eliminate either — but founders who build containment architecture, disaggregated evaluation, and legal guardrails before launch survive; founders who promise 'zero errors' do not ship, or ship and get sued.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: stop treating bias and hallucination as engineering bugs on a backlog. They are existential risks that belong in your board deck, your data room, and your first legal counsel call — not in a post-launch retro.",
