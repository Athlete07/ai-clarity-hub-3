  summary:
    "The founder's guide to AI evaluation beyond accuracy slides — offline vs online truth, benchmark theatre, production signals, regression discipline, and the five questions that protect you before every model swap.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Evaluation is a business governance system, not a dashboard exercise. Founders who ask what error costs money, whether offline metrics predict customer reality, and how regressions get caught before users do — ship AI that survives diligence and renewals; founders who accept headline accuracy ship demos that collapse in week three.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: before your next model update ships, ask your team for offline metrics, online metrics, and the last regression test result — in the same meeting. If they can only produce one of the three, you do not have an evaluation strategy. You have a launch prayer.",
