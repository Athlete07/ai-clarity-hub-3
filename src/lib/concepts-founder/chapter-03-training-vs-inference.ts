  summary:
    "Training is upfront CapEx; inference is per-user OpEx. Confusing them destroys unit economics and kills Series A companies that scale before the spreadsheet says they can.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Training buys capability once. Inference rents capability on every click. Founders who model inference cost per user before launch survive viral growth; founders who do not get a bridge-round conversation they did not plan for.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: when your CEO or board asks why you are not training your own foundation model, explain that you are buying variable inference to avoid fixed training CapEx — and show the spreadsheet that says when that trade flips.",
