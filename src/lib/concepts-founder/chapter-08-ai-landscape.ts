  summary:
    "The AI value chain from chips to applications — who captures margin, why foundation model providers hold power, and why thin wrappers around GPT-4 are not businesses.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The AI market has a clear value chain: compute and chips at the base, foundation models in the middle, applications at the top. Most venture dollars chase the application layer with wrapper economics — thin margins, no moat, instant replication. Founders who understand where power and margin accumulate choose wedges with defensibility: proprietary data, workflow embedding, vertical depth, or infrastructure picks-and-shovels.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: draw your company on the AI value chain in one sentence. If your answer is 'we put a UI on OpenAI,' you do not yet have a strategy — you have a demo. Investors have seen five hundred of those this quarter.",
