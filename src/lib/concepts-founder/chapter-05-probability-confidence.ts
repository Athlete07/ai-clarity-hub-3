  summary:
    "AI models don't look up answers — they sample from probability distributions. Founders who understand confidence, calibration, and thresholds ship products that manage expectations, survive diligence, and avoid promising deterministic magic.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "A model's confidence score is internal mathematical distance, not a guarantee of truth. What you promise customers, investors, and regulators is defined by the threshold where probability becomes action — and that is a founder decision, not an engineering default.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a founder: you own what your product promises. If you leave decision thresholds to engineering defaults, you inherit an arbitrary risk profile that assumes false positives and false negatives cost the same — and your churn, liability, and fundraising story will reflect it.",
