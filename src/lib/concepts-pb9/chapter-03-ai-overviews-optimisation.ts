  summary:
    "Ranking in the answer, not just below it — how to structure content that gets selected as source material for AI-generated search summaries",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI Overviews are Google's AI-generated summaries above organic results — 'position one' now includes being cited as a source inside the answer. Selection favours clear structure, direct answers, factual precision, trustworthy citations, and topical authority. For PMs, optimise for citation share and brand visibility alongside clicks — lead with answers, use Q&A patterns, maintain accuracy, and track when you appear or disappear in AI surfaces.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: AI Overviews change the success metric from CTR alone to citation + brand recall. Structure content so a machine can extract a correct 50-word answer without misrepresenting you. Invest in accuracy and primary-source citations — hallucinated summaries from sloppy pages damage trust. Report AI Overview appearances in cluster dashboards alongside GSC impressions.",
