  summary:
    "How search engines understand the world through named things — and how to make your brand, products, and content part of that knowledge graph",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Search no longer matches strings — it resolves entities. Google anchors queries to things in the Knowledge Graph: brands, people, products, places. PMs who optimise only for keywords miss the layer that powers AI answers, rich results, and brand panels. Entity-based SEO means making your organisation, authors, and product names unambiguously identifiable and richly connected — on-site, off-site, and in structured data — so search systems trust you as a source about those things.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: ask whether a user searching your brand name gets a Knowledge Panel or a list of confused homonyms. If it's the latter, your entity establishment programme is behind your content programme. Entity work is slower than publishing blog posts — but it compounds into citation moats AI systems reuse for years.",
