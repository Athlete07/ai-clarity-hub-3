  summary:
    "Optimising for the answer engines that are replacing blue links — how AI search surfaces select, cite, and summarise content, and the PM playbook for earning visibility when there is no position #1",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AIO (AI Search Optimisation) is the practice of earning citations and brand presence in AI-generated answers — not just ranking in traditional SERPs. PMs who optimise for extractability, entity authority, passage-level clarity, and multi-surface measurement build visibility across Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Bing Copilot. Traditional SEO fundamentals persist; AIO adds citation-worthiness as the new success criterion.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: AIO is not 'SEO plus schema.' It is a distinct visibility goal — being cited in AI answers when users never click a link. Build an AIO programme with citation tracking, extractability standards, and entity authority investment — or watch competitors become the default answer while your pages rank #3 unseen.",

Unlike traditional SEO where success is a ranking position and click, AIO success is citation in an AI response — Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT with browsing, Perplexity, Bing Copilot, and emerging answer engines.
