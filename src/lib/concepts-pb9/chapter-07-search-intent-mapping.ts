  summary:
    "The discipline that connects what users actually want to the content you build — classifying queries by intent, validating against SERPs, and matching formats so every page earns its place in the funnel",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Search intent is the organising principle behind every content decision — informational, navigational, transactional, and commercial investigation intents demand different formats, CTAs, and success metrics. PMs who map keywords to intent, validate against live SERPs, and measure alignment (not just rankings) build content portfolios that convert and survive algorithm shifts.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: stop approving content briefs that list keywords without intent labels. Every page needs a declared intent, a SERP-validated format, and a success metric matched to that intent — ranking position alone is the wrong KPI for half your portfolio.",

'Project management software' could mean learning what PM software is (informational), finding Asana's homepage (navigational), comparing tools before purchase (commercial investigation), or buying a subscription (transactional). Intent determines content format, page structure, CTA placement, and which metric defines success. Keyword volume without intent classification is a planning error.",

Blended SERPs show mixed content types — guides alongside product pages.

Multi-intent pages need clear section architecture — don't blend incompatible CTAs above the fold.",
