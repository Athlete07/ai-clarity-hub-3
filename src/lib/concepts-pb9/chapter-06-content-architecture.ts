  summary:
    "The structural decisions that determine whether your content compounds in value or collapses under its own weight",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Content architecture is the platform decision beneath every SEO tactic — URL hierarchy, taxonomy, canonicals, hub structure, crawl paths, and retirement policy. PMs who treat structure as 'the CMS team's problem' inherit cannibalisation, index bloat, and migration debt that no amount of keyword optimisation fixes. Good architecture makes topic clusters, schema, and entity pages discoverable; bad architecture buries them under duplicate URLs and orphaned posts.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: before approving the next 50 blog posts, ask whether your URL tree, internal links, and canonicals can support them — or whether you're adding weight to a structure that already confuses crawlers. Content architecture is cheaper to design in year one than to untangle in year three.",
