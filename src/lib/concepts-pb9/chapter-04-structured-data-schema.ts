  summary:
    "Speaking the language search engines prefer — the markup that makes your content machine-readable and eligible for rich results",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Structured data is not a ranking hack — it is a machine-readable contract between your content and search systems. JSON-LD schema tells Google what your page means (product, FAQ, article, organisation) so it can surface rich results and feed AI Overviews with trustworthy facts. PMs who treat schema as a one-time dev ticket miss the compounding value: every correctly marked page becomes a citation candidate with explicit fields search can extract without guessing.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: before you ask engineering for schema, map which content types drive revenue and which rich result formats apply. FAQ and HowTo schema on high-intent pages often beats Article schema on every blog post. Prioritise by traffic value × rich result eligibility × implementation cost — not by marking up the entire site at once.",
