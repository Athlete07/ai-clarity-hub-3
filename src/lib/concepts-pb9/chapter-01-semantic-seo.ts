  summary:
    "Beyond keywords — how search engines moved from matching strings to understanding meaning, and what that demands from your content",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Semantic SEO means optimising for topics, entities, and user intent — not keyword density. Search engines use knowledge graphs, NLP, and contextual signals to decide whether your content genuinely covers a subject. For PMs, the shift is strategic: topical depth compounds over years while keyword hacks decay every algorithm update. Invest in concept coverage, entity clarity, and intent-matched formats — measure cluster-level authority, not page-level keyword rankings alone.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: stop approving content briefs built around keyword lists and start approving topic coverage maps. Your content roadmap should answer 'what concepts must we own?' not 'what exact phrases do we repeat?' Resource semantic depth like product infrastructure — it is a compounding asset that protects organic acquisition when AI Overviews and zero-click SERPs eat individual page clicks.",
