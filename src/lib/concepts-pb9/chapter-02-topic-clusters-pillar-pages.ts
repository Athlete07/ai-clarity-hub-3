  summary:
    "The content architecture that signals expertise to search engines — and organises knowledge in a way users actually navigate",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Topic clusters replace flat keyword strategies with architecture: one comprehensive pillar page anchors a broad subject, cluster pages go deep on subtopics, and deliberate internal linking signals relationships to search engines and users. For PMs, clusters are product roadmaps for content — prioritise by business goals, measure at cluster level, and treat migration of legacy posts as a platform refactor, not a blogging side project.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: approve topic clusters the same way you approve feature epics — each cluster needs a business anchor, an owner, a coverage map, and success metrics. A pillar is not a long blog post; it is the hub users and crawlers orbit. If your site is a graveyard of unrelated posts, cluster architecture is the reorganisation that turns archive into acquisition infrastructure.",
