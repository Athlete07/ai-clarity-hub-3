  summary:
    "Post-deployment ROI tracking is where AI investments prove their worth or expose their weakness. Most AI programmes track the wrong things too late, report to the wrong audience, and fail to connect insights to reinvestment decisions. This chapter builds the tracking infrastructure, reporting cadence, and governance framework that makes post-deployment ROI a management tool rather than a compliance exercise.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Post-deployment ROI tracking is not a measurement exercise — it is a management tool. Leaders who use ROI data to make real-time decisions on adoption, programme design, and capital reallocation get more value from AI than leaders who produce ROI reports for historical record-keeping.",
