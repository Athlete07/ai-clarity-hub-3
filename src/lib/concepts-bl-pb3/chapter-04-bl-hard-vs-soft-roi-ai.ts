  summary:
    "Hard AI ROI has a direct P&L signature. Soft AI ROI is real but indirect — and systematically undervalued or overclaimed depending on whether the conversion methodology is honest. This chapter builds the framework for capturing both categories with the rigour that survives Finance scrutiny.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Soft ROI is not weak ROI — it is unquantified ROI waiting for a conversion methodology. Business leaders who dismiss it leave significant value off the table; leaders who overclaim it lose Finance credibility. The discipline is in the conversion, not the category.",
