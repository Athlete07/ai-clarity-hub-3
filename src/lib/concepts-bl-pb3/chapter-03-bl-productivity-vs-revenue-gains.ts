  summary:
    "Productivity gains and revenue gains from AI require completely different measurement models, different attribution methods, and different organisational changes to realise. Leaders who conflate them produce business cases where neither type of value is properly tracked or captured.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Productivity ROI is earned through capacity redeployment, not just time savings — and revenue ROI requires clean attribution design before deployment. Business leaders who treat these as one measurement problem consistently underperform on both.",
