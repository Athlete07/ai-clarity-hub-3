  summary:
    "AI cost-benefit analysis fails most often because the cost side is systematically underestimated and the benefit side is never stress-tested. This chapter builds a complete cost inventory, a benefit categorisation model, and a sensitivity analysis framework that will survive CFO scrutiny.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "A credible AI cost-benefit framework requires honest total cost of ownership — including change management, data preparation, and ongoing operations — balanced against rigorously categorised benefits with stated confidence levels. Leaders who build the full framework earn faster approvals and fewer post-deployment surprises.",
