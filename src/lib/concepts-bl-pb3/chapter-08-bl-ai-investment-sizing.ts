  summary:
    "Sizing an AI investment incorrectly — either too small to deliver meaningful value or too large for organisational absorptive capacity — is one of the most common causes of AI programme failure. This chapter builds the framework for right-sizing AI investments using portfolio logic, phased commitment, payback analysis, and capital allocation discipline.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI investment size should be determined by organisational absorptive capacity, not by technology ambition or vendor proposal. The right AI investment is the largest amount the organisation can deploy, adopt, and measure effectively — and no larger.",
