  summary:
    "The CFO is the most important audience for any significant AI ROI presentation — and the audience most likely to challenge superficial or optimistic claims. This chapter builds the language, financial model structure, and presentation discipline to earn CFO confidence and accelerate AI investment approval.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "CFOs approve AI investments when they trust the financial model, understand the risk structure, and believe the sponsor has considered what could go wrong. The path to CFO approval is not through enthusiasm for AI — it is through financial rigour, honest uncertainty, and specific answers to predictable challenges.",

      take: "CFOs evaluate AI investments through four questions: Is the financial model rigorous and conservative? What is the worst credible outcome? How does this compete with other uses of capital? And who is accountable for delivery? Presentations that answer all four questions earn approval; presentations that answer one or two invite challenge.",
      why: "Most AI investment presentations are built by technology or programme teams who frame AI in terms of capability and potential. CFOs frame investments in terms of risk-adjusted return and accountability. The framing mismatch is the primary reason good AI investments fail to get CFO approval on the first submission.",

            "The way to pass this challenge is to build the model conservatively and flag your own limitations before they do.

            "Presenting the worst credible outcome proactively demonstrates that you have stress-tested the model.
