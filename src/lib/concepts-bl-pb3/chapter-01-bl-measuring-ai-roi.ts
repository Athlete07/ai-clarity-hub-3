  summary:
    "Most AI investments fail the ROI test not because they deliver no value, but because business leaders never defined how they would measure it. This chapter builds the measurement framework before deployment — so you can prove, defend, and improve the return on every AI dollar.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI ROI is measurable, but only if you define the measurement architecture before you deploy. Leaders who build the framework upfront close the loop between AI spend and business outcomes; leaders who improvise after the fact struggle to justify the next investment.",
