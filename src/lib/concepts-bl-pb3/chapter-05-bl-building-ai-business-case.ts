  summary:
    "A winning AI business case is not a financial model with a cover page — it is a structured argument that addresses the concerns of every decision-maker in the approval chain. This chapter builds the complete business case: problem statement, options analysis, financial model, risk register, and governance framework.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI business cases fail approval not because the investment is poor, but because the case is incomplete. Every approval decision-maker has a specific question the case must answer. Business leaders who map the questions before writing the case are more likely to get approval on the first submission.",
