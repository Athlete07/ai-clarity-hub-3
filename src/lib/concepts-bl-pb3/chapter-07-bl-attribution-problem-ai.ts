  summary:
    "Attribution — determining how much of the observed improvement was actually caused by AI — is the hardest methodological challenge in AI ROI measurement. This chapter gives business leaders the tools to design credible attribution, understand the limits of each method, and communicate uncertainty honestly without surrendering the ROI claim.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Perfect attribution is impossible in most real-world AI deployments. Credible attribution — with stated methodology, honest confidence intervals, and transparent assumptions — is achievable and sufficient for decision-making. Leaders who demand perfect attribution delay decisions indefinitely; leaders who accept credible attribution make better investments faster.",
