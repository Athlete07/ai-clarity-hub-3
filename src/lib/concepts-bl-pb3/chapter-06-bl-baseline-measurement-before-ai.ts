  summary:
    "The baseline is the most important measurement in any AI investment — and the most consistently neglected. Without a documented, Finance-approved baseline measured before deployment, every ROI claim is an assertion, not an evidence-based result. This chapter builds the baseline measurement discipline that makes post-deployment ROI credible.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "A baseline measured after deployment is not a baseline — it is a post-hoc benchmark. Business leaders who insist on pre-deployment baseline measurement and Finance sign-off are the ones whose post-deployment ROI reports survive scrutiny without revision.",
