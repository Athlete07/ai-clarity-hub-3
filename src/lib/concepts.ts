The discipline that keeps it sane isn't fancy tooling — it's a rule that branches are short-lived (a few days, not weeks) and PRs are small (under a few hundred lines whenever possible). The result is that main is almost always shippable, and most merges are uneventful. When PMs ask why a Stripe-shaped team can release dozens of times a day while their team releases weekly, this is the answer hiding in the repo.",
