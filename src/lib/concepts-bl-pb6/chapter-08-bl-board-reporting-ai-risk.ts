  summary:
    "Boards are increasingly expected to oversee AI risk — by regulators, investors, and the organisations they govern. But most board AI reports are either too technical (boards cannot exercise governance) or too vague (boards cannot make decisions). Business leaders who design effective AI board reporting enable governance; those who design poor reports create liability.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Effective board AI risk reporting has three purposes: enabling oversight (the board can assess whether AI risk is being managed), enabling decisions (the board can make resource and strategy decisions about AI risk), and enabling accountability (the board can hold management accountable for AI governance commitments). Reports that serve all three purposes in under 10 pages are the standard.",
