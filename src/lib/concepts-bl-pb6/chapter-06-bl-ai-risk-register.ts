  summary:
    "An AI risk register is the operational backbone of your AI governance programme — a living document that maps every material AI risk, its likelihood, impact, owner, and mitigation status. Business leaders who treat AI risk management as a compliance exercise rather than an operational discipline create the conditions for avoidable incidents.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Every deployed AI system carries a distinct risk profile across six categories: technical failure, data quality, bias and discrimination, regulatory compliance, third-party dependency, and reputational risk. The AI risk register maps these risks per system, assigns owners, and tracks mitigation status — enabling leadership decisions about risk acceptance versus investment.",
