  readingMinutes: 24,
  summary:
    "Explainability — the ability to explain why an AI system produced a specific output — is both a regulatory requirement and a business risk management tool. Black-box AI deployed in consequential decisions creates legal exposure under GDPR, the EU AI Act, and employment law. Business leaders must understand when explainability is required and how to design AI governance around it.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Explainability is not a technical nice-to-have — it is a legal requirement for AI systems making consequential decisions about individuals, and a prerequisite for meaningful human oversight. Business leaders who deploy unexplainable AI in high-stakes contexts own the liability for decisions they cannot audit, review, or defend.",
