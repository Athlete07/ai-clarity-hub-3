  readingMinutes: 22,
  summary:
    "Most enterprise AI is not built in-house — it is procured from vendors, consumed as APIs, or embedded in SaaS platforms. Every third-party AI introduces risks that the deploying organisation is legally and operationally responsible for. Business leaders who manage vendor commercial relationships without AI-specific risk governance own the liability for AI failures they never caused.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Third-party AI risk has four dimensions: vendor compliance (are they meeting regulatory obligations on your behalf), concentration risk (how dependent is your operation on a single AI provider), supply chain risk (what AI is in the tools your vendors use), and contractual risk (does your contract protect you when the AI fails). All four require active management.",
