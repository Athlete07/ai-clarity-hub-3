  summary:
    "AI systems fail in distinctive ways: silently, at scale, and often in ways that compound over time before detection. A well-designed AI incident response programme — with defined classification, detection, escalation, investigation, and remediation protocols — is the difference between a managed operational failure and a regulatory crisis.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI incident response requires classification (severity determines response speed), detection (monitoring that catches failures before customers do), escalation (defined pathways from operational team to board), investigation (root cause before remediation), remediation (fix and verify), and notification (regulators and affected individuals where required). Business leaders own the escalation decision — not the technical investigation.",

      subtitle: "The distinctive characteristics of AI failures — and why standard incident response frameworks need AI-specific extensions",
      take: "AI incidents differ from standard IT incidents in four ways: they are often silent (no error generated), they are often slow (performance degrades gradually), they affect many people simultaneously when they occur, and their root cause is often in training data or model architecture rather than code. Standard incident response frameworks designed for software bugs address none of these characteristics.",
      why: "Applying standard IT incident response to AI failures produces delayed detection, inadequate investigation, and incomplete remediation. A credit model that drifts for six months before producing enough complaints to trigger a review is not a standard software incident — it is an AI-specific failure mode that requires AI-specific detection and response.",

            "This means standard monitoring approaches — watching for error rates, application crashes, and service unavailability — are inadequate for AI incident detection. AI monitoring must watch for performance metric changes, output distribution shifts, and user experience signals that indicate model behaviour has changed.",

            "Without trend monitoring and threshold alerting that triggers at the onset of degradation rather than at crisis level, slow failures are only detected when they produce enough customer complaints or operational impact to be visible — at which point significant harm has already occurred.",

Detection was triggered by a complaint spike that prompted the first post-deployment performance analysis.
