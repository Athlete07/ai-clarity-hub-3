  summary:
    "AI governance does not require a dedicated department or a multi-year transformation programme. Minimum viable governance — the smallest set of policies, processes, and controls that materially reduces your legal, operational, and reputational risk — can be built in weeks. Business leaders who wait for perfect governance deploy with no governance.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Minimum viable AI governance has five components: an AI inventory, a classification framework, a pre-deployment gate with legal and DPO review, an acceptable use policy, and a named accountability owner. These five components address the majority of regulatory exposure and can be operational within 60 days.",
