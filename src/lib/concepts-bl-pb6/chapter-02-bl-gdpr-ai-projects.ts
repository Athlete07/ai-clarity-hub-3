  readingMinutes: 25,
  summary:
    "GDPR does not just govern data storage — it governs every AI system that processes personal data of EU residents, which means almost every enterprise AI project. Business leaders need a working knowledge of GDPR's AI-specific obligations: lawful basis, purpose limitation, data minimisation, automated decision-making rights, and Data Protection Impact Assessments.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "GDPR's Article 22 creates a near-absolute right not to be subject to solely automated decisions with legal or significant effects. Any AI system making or significantly influencing decisions about EU individuals — in HR, credit, marketing, or operations — must have lawful basis, human oversight, and meaningful contestation rights in place before go-live.",
