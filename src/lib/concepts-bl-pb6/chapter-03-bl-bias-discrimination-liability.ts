  readingMinutes: 25,
  summary:
    "AI bias is not a technical problem that engineers solve before handing a system to the business — it is an ongoing legal liability that the deploying organisation owns. Discrimination in AI hiring, credit, housing, and customer service carries the same legal exposure as human discrimination, plus the amplification risk of automated scale.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The organisation deploying an AI system owns the discrimination liability for its outputs — 'the algorithm decided' is not a legal defence. Business leaders must mandate bias testing before deployment, establish protected characteristic monitoring in production, and maintain human override authority for consequential decisions affecting protected groups.",
