  readingMinutes: 26,
  summary:
    "The EU AI Act is the world's first comprehensive AI regulation and it is already in force. Business leaders in any organisation selling into, operating in, or processing data from the EU must map every AI system to the Act's risk tiers before deployment — or face fines up to 3% of global turnover.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "The EU AI Act classifies AI by risk tier — unacceptable, high-risk, limited-risk, and minimal-risk. High-risk systems in HR, credit, and critical infrastructure require conformity assessments, transparency obligations, and human oversight architecture before go-live. Your job is knowing where each AI system in your portfolio sits.",
