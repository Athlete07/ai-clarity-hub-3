  summary:
    "An ethical AI policy that employees cannot apply in practice is a public relations document. A policy that meaningfully shapes AI deployment decisions, resolves ethical dilemmas, and creates genuine accountability is a governance instrument. Business leaders who design ethical AI policy around operational reality — not philosophical ideals — build the policies that actually change behaviour.",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Ethical AI policy has three tiers: principles (aspirational values that define what you stand for), standards (specific rules that operationalise the principles), and procedures (the processes that embed the standards in daily decisions). All three tiers are required. Principles without standards are aspirational; standards without procedures are unenforced.",
