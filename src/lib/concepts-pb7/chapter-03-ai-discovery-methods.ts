  keyTakeaway:
    "AI discovery fails when it starts with model capability and hunts for a use case. Mature PMs hold capability-led and problem-led discovery in tension: map high-frequency painful tasks, run automation suitability and opportunity sizing, validate with shadowing and Wizard of Oz, then score candidates on impact, feasibility, data, and risk before a single fine-tune dollar is spent.",
