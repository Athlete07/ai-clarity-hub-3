    "Writing product requirements for features that are probabilistic, non-deterministic, and dependent on data — the PM craft that most teams get wrong",
  keyTakeaway:
    "An AI PRD is a cross-functional contract, not a feature wishlist. It must specify success metrics, model requirements, evaluation criteria, failure modes, data dependencies, and human fallback before engineering starts — because you cannot retrofit quality gates after a model ships.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: if your PRD doesn't define what 'good enough' means numerically, who owns the training data, and what happens when the model fails, you don't have an AI spec — you have a demo request. Write the eval criteria first; the UI mockups second.",
