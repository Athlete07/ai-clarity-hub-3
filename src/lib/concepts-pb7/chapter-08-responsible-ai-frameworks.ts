  summary:
    "The operational structures that make ethical AI a practice, not a principle — what leading teams actually do, not just believe",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Responsible AI is operationalised through frameworks (NIST AI RMF, vendor standards), impact assessments, model cards, accountability RACI, ongoing monitoring, and vendor due diligence — not ethics statements. PMs who embed these practices in the release process make safety a gate, not a poster.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: a Responsible AI PDF on the wiki is not a practice. Ship only features that pass impact assessment, have model cards, name an accountable owner, and include post-launch monitoring — or you're running an ethics theatre program.",
