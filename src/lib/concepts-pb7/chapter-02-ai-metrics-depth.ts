  summary:
    "Measuring AI products is different from measuring conventional software — the metrics layer that separates mature AI teams from ones flying blind",
  keyTakeaway:
    "DAU and NPS tell you if users show up; they don't tell you if the model still works. Mature AI teams instrument task completion, containment, hallucination rate, drift, and online evals — and tie leading signals (thumbs-down, abandonment) to lagging business outcomes before users churn silently.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: block launch until you can answer 'did the AI accomplish the user's job?' on a sampled basis. If your dashboard only shows requests and latency, you're operating a black box with a pretty usage chart.",
