  summary:
    "Planning under uncertainty — the roadmapping practices that work for AI products, where timelines are unpredictable and quality is probabilistic",
  keyTakeaway:
    "AI roadmaps gate on eval results and data readiness, not calendar dates. PMs who sequence foundation (eval, observability, data) before features, plan scenario bands instead of single deadlines, and name technical debt categories avoid the prototype-to-production cliff that kills AI programs.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: stop committing AI features to Q3 ship dates before eval infrastructure exists. Roadmap milestones should be '≥90% golden-set task completion' and 'data pipeline live' — not 'demo ready.' Confidence increases each quarter; fantasy dates do not.",
