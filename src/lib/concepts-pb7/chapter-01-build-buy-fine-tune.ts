  summary:
    "The most consequential architectural decision a PM makes — and the framework for making it well",
  keyTakeaway:
    "Build, buy, and fine-tune are not three equal options — they are three layers of a stack. Most durable AI products buy the base model, fine-tune for behaviour where prompting fails, and build the surrounding product system. The PM job is to map differentiation, data advantage, timeline, and exit cost — then document the decision before engineering commits.",
  pmCallout:
    "As a PM: never let 'we'll use GPT' or 'we'll train our own model' be the first sentence in a PRD. Start with what must be differentiated, what data you own, and what happens if the vendor doubles price or deprecates the API. The build vs buy decision is a finance and legal conversation dressed as an architecture choice.",

      take: "Build means you own the full stack — data pipelines, training, serving, and product integration. Buy means you license capability from a vendor and integrate via API or SaaS. Fine-tune means you start from a foundation model and adapt weights or behaviour with your data — you don't train from random init, but you don't get a black-box API either.",
